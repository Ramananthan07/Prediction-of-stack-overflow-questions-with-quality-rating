34562473,Most Pythonic way to kill a thread after some period of time,"<p>I would like to run a process in a thread (which is iterating over a large database table). While the thread is running, I just want the program to wait. If that thread takes longer then 30 seconds, I want to kill the thread and do something else. By killing the thread, I mean that I want it to cease activity and release resources gracefully.</p>

<p>I figured the best way to do this was through a <code>Thread()</code>'s <code>join(delay)</code> and <code>is_alive()</code> functions, and an <code>Event</code>. Using the <code>join(delay)</code> I can have my program wait 30 seconds for the thread to finish, and by using the <code>is_alive()</code> function I can determine if the thread has finished its work. If it hasn't finished its work, the event is set, and the thread knows to stop working at that point.</p>

<p>Is this approach valid, and is this the most pythonic way to go about my problem statement?</p>

<p>Here is some sample code:</p>

<pre><code>import threading
import time

# The worker loops for about 1 minute adding numbers to a set
# unless the event is set, at which point it breaks the loop and terminates

t.start()

# wait 30 seconds for the thread to finish its work
t.join(30)

    print ""thread is not done, setting event to kill thread.""

34566278,How to correctly share JAX-RS 2.0 client,"<p>To give a little context to my issue...</p>

<p>I have a Java EE web application (as a UI / client) that accesses services for data / business logic via a REST interface using the JAX-RS 2.0 client API (Resteasy implementation).</p>

<p>Currently I inject a new JAXRS Client instance per request using a RequestScoped CDI managed bean, the thinking being that the client app may call multiple backend resources per request and I reuse the same JAXRS Client for the whole request (although I read somewhere this may not be correct as I am potentially changing the URI for each invocation)</p>

<p>The documentation for JAXRS Client seems to suggest that the client is a potentially expensive operation and the app should limit the amount of connections it creates.  It also seems to contradict itself and suggest the client should be closed once all the requests to a particular WebTarget are finished.</p>

<p>The client application could potentially support thousands of simultaneous users  so creating and destroying thousands of 'expensive clients' does not seem to be the correct approach so am thinking a shared client pool is more appropriate but there doesn't seem to be any information on how this should be achieved.</p>

<p>All examples appear to show creating a new client for the request and a) closing it after or b) not closing it but not really explaining what happens on a second request.</p>

<p>Can you help provide some answers on how you think this would be solved or information on what the best practice for this approach is.</p>

34583925,Cannot find alphabet symbol,"<p>I'm trying to compile this code, but I get a <code>cannot find symbol - variable alphabet</code> . I don't understand why, because <code>alphabet</code> is being declared its value, that much is apparent. Is there something I'm missing here? My code aims to encrypt and decrypt messages, by using two keys that work by dividing up the letters so that every other letter is encrypted by one key starting from index 0, and every other letter from the index of 1 is encrypted by another key. These two sets of letters are calculated and weaved back together to form one decrypted string. In any case I'm only interested in finding out why I get a <code>cannot find symbol - variable alphabet</code>error. Any other suggestions for my code is appreciated but not necessary. Thanks!   </p>

Calling <code>getClass</code> on the functional parameter works fine for normal classes, and I can <code>getEnclosingClass</code> for nested or anonymous classes; but if it's a lambda expression, it returns some obscure name containing <code>$$Lambda$</code>, which I could strip off manually like this:</p>

34604508,How to create a duplicate of a stack in Java,"<p>My teacher requested that I create a duplicate of a Stack that returns a new Stack containing the same elements and in the same order as the specified Stack.</p>

<p>If I am only able to use methods that are unique to Stack, I would pop every element off the Stack and onto a que. Then I would pop from the bottom of the que onto a new Stack and return the new Stack.</p>

<p>However, I figured that since Stack inherits from Vector I could just use the addAll() method from Vector!</p>

<p>Here is the Java code implementation:</p>

<pre><code>public class DuplicateStack {

private Stack backStack;

public Stack duplicateStack(Stack s) {
    backStack.addAll(s);
    return backStack;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would seem to do all the work for me. Only problem is, I keep getting a nullPointerException when I run this in my main:</p>

<pre><code>Stack s1 = new Stack();
s1.push(""c"");
s1.push(""b"");
s1.push(""a"");

DuplicateStack dup = new DuplicateStack();
Stack s2 = dup.duplicateStack(s1);

while(!s2.empty())
    System.out.println(s2.pop());
</code></pre>

<p>The error comes from the addAll() call in my DuplicateStack class.
So my question is why am I getting a nullPointerException from the addAll(), and is there any way to make a duplicate copy other than using the method stated earlier (using only Stack unique methods)?</p>

34615796,pure Domain Driven Design in PHP project,"<p>In ""PHP World"" there is a weird feeling about infrastructure layer in any DDD application (example) what I could found.</p>

<p>I see many examples, when developers using <code>Doctrine2</code> in infrastructure layer, use Domain entities (from Domain layer) as <code>Doctrine2</code> models, puting doc comments on top on it, or mention them in config (xml, yml).
For instance, <a href=""https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample"" rel=""nofollow"">Big Blue Book example</a>, this is where domain entities are located: <a href=""https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample/tree/master/CargoBackend/src/Model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codeliner/php-ddd-cargo-sample/tree/master/CargoBackend/src/Model</a>, and as you can see it's highly coupled with Doctrine (look on annotations). Are they ?</p>

<p>I've feeling that this is wrong way.</p>

<p>What I understood about DDD, is:
Repository should make a query to persistence layer and pass result to factory to instantiate <code>Aggregate Root</code> entity (Domain model) properly. It means that only Factory knows how specific Aggregate Root might be instantiated, moreover there is a, so called, entities lyfe cycle. It means that not every time Domain entity should be instantiated (hydrated) via <code>__construct</code>.</p>

Connecting to byebug server localhost:58501...
Connected.

<p>Is there something incorrect in my configuration, or is sidekiq just not compatible with byebug's remote debugging? </p>

34622076,Calling an explicit constructor with a braced-init list: ambiguous or not?,"<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>struct A {
    A(int, int) { }
};

struct B {
    B(A ) { }                   // (1)
    explicit B(int, int ) { }   // (2)
};

int main() {
    B paren({1, 2});   // (3)
    B brace{1, 2};     // (4)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The construction of <code>brace</code> in <code>(4)</code> clearly and unambiguously calls <code>(2)</code>. On clang, the construction of <code>paren</code> in <code>(3)</code> unambiguously calls <code>(1)</code> where as on gcc 5.2, it fails to compile with:</p>

<pre><code>main.cpp: In function 'int main()':
main.cpp:11:19: error: call of overloaded 'B(&lt;brace-enclosed initializer list&gt;)' is ambiguous
     B paren({1, 2});
                   ^
main.cpp:6:5: note: candidate: B::B(A)
     B(A ) { }

 struct B {
        ^
main.cpp:5:8: note: candidate: constexpr B::B(B&amp;&amp;)
</code></pre>

<p>Which compiler is right? I suspect clang is correct here, as the ambiguity in gcc can only arise through a path that involves implicitly constructing <code>B{1,2}</code> and passing that to the copy/move constructor - yet that constructor is marked <code>explicit</code>, so such implicit construction should not be allowed. </p>

<p>Is there a way to use similar approach to perform additional integration test on <code>ZuulProxy</code>? What I would like to achieve is being able to mock remote servers that <code>ZuulProxy</code> would forward to and validate that all of my <code>ZuulFitler</code>s behaved as expected. However, <code>ZuulProxy</code> is using <code>RestClient</code> from Netflix (deprecated it would seem?) which naturally does not use <code>RestTemplate</code> which could be re-configured by <code>MockRestServiceServer</code> and I currently can't find a good way of mocking responses from remote services for proxied requests.</p>

<p>I have a micro-service that is responsible for handling API Session Key creation and then will act similar to an API Gateway. Forwarding is done with Zuul Proxy to underlying exposed services, and Zuul Filters will detect if Session key is valid or not. An integration test would therefore create a valid session and then forward to a fake endpoint, e.g 'integration/test'.</p>

<p>Specifying that 'integration/test' is a new endpoint is possible by setting a configuration property on <code>@WebIntegrationTest</code>, I can successfully mock all services that are being handled via <code>RestTemplate</code> but not Zuul forwarding.</p>

I have searched this on google and stack overflow and from my understanding all previous questions have been asking how to detect if the notification was missed one the app is opened which I do not need.</p>

<p>At this point, I can properly run code if the user responds to the notification by pressing one of the options on the notification by this :</p>

<pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, handleActionWithIdentifier identifier: String?, forLocalNotification notification: UILocalNotification, withResponseInfo responseInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject], completionHandler: () -&gt; Void) {
        var userInfo = [NSObject: AnyObject]()
        userInfo[""text""] = responseInfo[UIUserNotificationActionResponseTypedTextKey]
        NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotificationName(""text"", object: nil, userInfo: userInfo)

        print(userInfo)

        completionHandler()
    }
</code></pre>

<p>as of right now, I am just taking textfield input and printing it but I could launch a second notification if I wanted. Is there a method to detecting when a notification is missed and scheduling another notification?</p>

<p>There is always a chance that it is still not possible to do what I want and I would just schedule 10 notifications in advance which seems sloppy and does not let me make the response as iterative.</p>

<p>TLDR; how do I detect and run code if a local notification is missed WITHOUT opening the app</p>

<p>BTW: if you have answers, swift is the preferred language</p>

<p>My Angular/NodeJS app has a payment page (for monthly and annual subscriptions) handled through Stripe.</p>

<p>I've created the subscription types in my Stripe dashboard (two subscriptions: <code>StarterAnnual</code> and <code>StarterMonthly</code>), and I've set up the handler like so:</p>

<pre><code>  var handler = StripeCheckout.configure({

            console.log(token)
            var tempObj = {
                stripeToken : token,
                email : $scope.user.email,
                cost : $scope.plan.price * 100
                plan : $scope.plan.name
            }
            $http.post('/api/makePayment', tempObj).then(function(data){

                console.log('stripe error', err);
            })
          }
        });

        handler.open({
          name: '&lt;bizname&gt;',
          description: $scope.plan.name,
          amount: $scope.plan.price * 100
        });
</code></pre>

<p>In my Node route, I'm doing this:</p>

<pre><code>exports.makePayment = function(req,res){

  var stripeToken = req.body.stripeToken,
            email = req.body.email,
             cost = req.body.cost,
             plan = req.body.plan;

  var tempObj = {
    source: stripeToken,
    plan: plan,
    email: email
  }

  console.log(tempObj); // Everything looks fine in this log

  stripe.customers.create(tempObj, function(err, customer) {
    if(err){

Looking at the output of <code>python -m cProfile &lt;script&gt;</code>, it doesn't seem to include <code>import</code> statements (understandably given potentially huge dependency trees). Initially I thought it did since I saw a row for <code>__import__()</code> calls, but I think this might actually be because code somewhere is explicitly calling it, toy programs with only <code>import</code> statements don't have a row for it.</p>

<p>Right now I'm just using:</p>

<p>Is there any cleaner way for me to organize everything? I'd like to split up the state between the various components (CPU, GPU, cartridge bank switching, etc), if possible. Is it idiomatic to have a big monolithic state type in Haskell?</p>

<p>It's a pretty big pain to add new state to the program. The Control.Lens package seems to be up the right alley, but I'm not sure if I can combine it with ST very easily.</p>

But currently I am facing issue with OkHttp Interceptor. The server I am communicating with is taking access token in body of request, so when I intercept the request to add auth token or in authenticate method of Authenticator when I need to add updated auth token, I need to modify body of request for this purpose. But it looks like I can only add data in headers but not in the body of ongoing request. The code I have written so far is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>client.interceptors().add(new Interceptor() {
            @Override
            public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException {
                Request request = chain.request();
                if (UserPreferences.ACCESS_TOKEN != null) {
                    // need to add this access token in request body as encoded form field instead of header
                    request = request.newBuilder()
                            .header(""access_token"", UserPreferences.ACCESS_TOKEN))
                            .method(request.method(), request.body())
                            .build();

                return response;
            }

However, if I have registered a callback to run upon completion of that future, how can I wait not only for the future to complete but also for that callback to finish?</p>

<p>Here is a minimal but complete program to illustrate the problem:</p>

<pre><code>import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration
import scala.concurrent.{ Await, Future }

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val f: Future[Int] = Future(0)
    f.onSuccess { case _ =&gt;
      Thread.sleep(10000)
      println(""The program waited patiently for this callback to finish."")
    }

    // This waits for `f` to complete but doesn't wait for the callback
    // to finish running.
    Await.ready(f, Duration.Inf)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I expect the output to be:</p>

<pre><code>The program waited patiently for this callback to finish.
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, there is no output; the program exits before the callback finishes.</p>

            &lt;my-form-input [(inputModel)]=""name"" [inputField]=""myFormInputName""&gt;&lt;/my-form-input&gt;

...
            &lt;my-form-input [(inputModel)]=""lastItem"" [inputField]=""lastItemName""&gt;&lt;/my-form-input&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a following setup and can't figure out, how to make it right:</p>

<p>The component:</p>

<pre><code>import {Component,Input, Output,EventEmitter} from 'angular2/core'
import {FORM_DIRECTIVES}    from 'angular2/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-form-input',
  directives: [FORM_DIRECTIVES],

    `
    &lt;input type=""text"" class=""form-control""  id=""i1"" required [ngModel]=""inputModel"" (ngModelChange)=""onChangeInput($event)"" ngControl=""ctrl"" #ctrl=""ngForm""/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{{""Is field valid? I would like to make some decisions here depending on that: ""+ctrl.valid}}&lt;/p&gt;

  `
})
export class InputComponent {

  constructor(){};

  @Input()  inputField:string;
  @Input()  inputModel: Object;
  @Output() inputModelChange = new EventEmitter();

  onChangeInput(event){
    this.inputModel=event;
    this.inputModelChange.emit(event);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The app:</p>

<pre><code>//our root app component
import {Component} from 'angular2/core'
import {FORM_DIRECTIVES}    from 'angular2/common';
import {InputComponent} from './my.input'


@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  providers: [],
  template: `
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to make a custom 2 way binding form input component having also validation?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;form #f=""ngForm""&gt;

        &lt;my-form-input [(inputModel)]=""name"" [inputField]=""myFormInputName""&gt;&lt;/my-form-input&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;{{name}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  `,
  directives: [InputComponent,FORM_DIRECTIVES]
})
export class App {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Angular2'

34856926,Transparent AppBarLayout and CollapsingToolbarLayout,"<p>I would like to achive the following layout:</p>

<ol>
<li>Map as a base layout</li>
<li>Transparent window above inside a CollapsingToolbarLayout</li>
<li>RecyclerView for content</li>
</ol>

<p>I included an example of how this should look like.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gpph.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gpph.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I was following this great example from  <a href=""https://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquare"">Cheesesquare</a> for the CollapsingToolbarLayout and AppBarLayout implementation. I managed to get the content working with the map inside the CollapsingToolbarLayout (commented out in the layout xml), but this is not the desired result.</p>

<p>However I did not find any solution / documentation to make the grey box (see inside image in the middle) to be transparent in the initial position. I would like it to be transparent in order to see through to the map. When the user would scroll up, the CollapsingToolbarLaoyut should do it's work and collapse the transparent window and show the Toolbar. For now the image looks just white or whatever color I give it. I already tried to set the color to transparent, but it didn't have the desired effect.</p>

<p><strong>So my question</strong>: <em>How could I set the ""CollapsingToolbarLayout"" transparent in the initial phase (see image Layer 1 grey box)?</em></p>

<p>Here is my code for the layout. The CollapsingToolbarLayout works great, but I can't see the map below. Would be great if it would be possible to implement. </p>

34880946,Not understanding some programming patterns,"<p>When I read experienced programmers code, I realize some patterns which I would not consider optimized code. I've been searching for this on google but there's no discuss on the topic that I could find.</p>

<p>What is the reason behind declaring all variables at the beginning of the program? For example, why does someone use:</p>

<pre><code>GtkWidget *window;

gtk_init(NULL, NULL);

window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
</code></pre>

<p>instead of </p>

<pre><code>gtk_init(NULL, NULL);

GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
</code></pre>

<p>Or, for example, why does one declare a variable <code>i</code> for a loop like</p>

<pre><code>int i;
char *a;

(code)

for(i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>instead of declaring <code>i</code> just above the for loop?</p>

<pre><code>char *a;

(code)

int i;
for(i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>I think it would be easier to read. Isn't that just giving away memory? Because until the time the <code>for</code> is called, there are 4 bytes in memory which are not used.</p>

<p>I'm not remembering other patterns that I use to see in others code but I find very often things like this that I'd like to know why are like this; specially if they are not optimized (I guess). I asked some people why they do things like this but they either tell me they were taught like that or they get offended like I shouldn't have asked that.</p>

<p>I genuinely interested in knowing why do programmers structure their code like this in order to understand and improve my coding.
And if you have any advice on how to structure code or tips on good programming behaviours, please let me know.</p>

34905628,"How to implement OAuth2 ""Token Exchange"" with Spring Cloud Security","<p>I would like to know if someone has an example to see how to implement ""Token Exchange"" technique with Spring Cloud Security (with OAuth2).</p>

<p>Currently I have implemented ""Token Relay"" technique in a Microservices Environment using ZuulProxy to ""relay"" the OAuth2 token and implementing SSO. This is great but implies that every microservice uses the same clientId (which is specified in ZuulProxy setup as ZuulProxy relays the token only with authorization_code grant type and the clientId provided).
However, for intra-microservices calls I would like to ""exchange"" the token. This means in some cases the token that ZuulProxy relays is not the one I need to use to authenticate/authorize Microservice A as client of Microservice B.</p>

<p>The Spring Cloud reference documentation currently says: ""Building on Spring Boot and Spring Security OAuth2 we can quickly create systems that implement common patterns like single sign on, token relay and <strong>token exchange</strong>."" (<a href=""http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-security/spring-cloud-security.html"">http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-security/spring-cloud-security.html</a>)</p>

<p>I guess that with ""Token Exchange"" in the reference documentation they mean the implementation of this extension of OAuth2, explained in this spec, which is basically what I need:
<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-03"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-03</a></p>

<p>As I said, I understand how to use SSO and Token Relay but I'm not able to see further explanation about how to implement ""Token exchange"" in the reference documentation. I was not able to find an implementation example either.</p>

<p>Does anyone know where I can find further information or an example?</p>

        ...
      })
      ...
  }
}

<p>The receiveLogin action updates the isAuthenticated flag in the state to true. My protected route has the following onEnter hook:</p>

<pre><code>export default (state) =&gt; {
  return {
    path: '/',
    component: App,
    childRoutes: [
      {
        path: 'protected',

<p>As you can see, I am passing the state in as an argument. This gives me access to the initial state from the server as well as on the client. However, after my login action happens, obviously the onEnter hook will still be using the initial state. </p>

<p>What I want to know is the best way to get the current state after the isAuthenticated flag is updated and use that in my onEnter hook instead. Or, is my approach totally flawed and should I be doing this a different way entirely?</p>

<p>It takes about half a second and it works just fine. Operations are fairly quick as well. Dividing it by 10 (without decimals) to shift the digits is quick. However, <code>str(prime)</code> is taking a very long time. I reimplemented <code>str</code> like this, and found it was processing about a hundred or so digits per second.</p>

    strprime += str(prime%10)

In order to do this, I thought there might be an option to exclude the files that I don't want them to go to ""common"" file. If I use this output, what is the point for long term caching files for library bundles because whenever I get a common component in my project, they will go into the common bundle and the content hash will be different, but nothing changes in this library files like react, jquery, lodash, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I have at the end of build process is everything still goes into the common bundle and lib has nothing and the file sizes are :</p>

app2.&lt;hash&gt;.min.js -&gt; 3.05KB
lib.&lt;hash&gt;.min.js -&gt; 165 Bytes (has almost nothing!)

<p>Here is my manifest.json:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""manifest_version"": 2,

  ""name""       : ""Chrome Autobot"",
  ""description"": ""This extension will run various automation scripts for google chrome"",
  ""version""    : ""1.0"",

  ""browser_action"" : {
    ""default_icon"" : ""icon.png"",
    ""default_popup"": ""index.html""
  },
  ""permissions"": [
    ""activeTab"",
    ""webNavigation"",
    ""tabs"",
    ""http://*/*"",
    ""https://*/*""
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my chrome script: </p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function($) {
    ""Use Strict"";

    var openWebmail = function() {
        chrome.tabs.create({
            url: 'http://mywebmaillogin.com:2095/'
        }, function() {
            chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, {file: ""scripts/openEmail.js""});
        });
        chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(){
            chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, {file: ""scripts/openEmail.js""});
            alert('i work');
        });
    };

    var init = $('.script-init');
    init.on('click', function() {
        openWebmail();
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the content script to be executed as a callback of tab creation (when the email login page is fetched and the DOM has loaded), and also when the email credentials are submitted and the client selection page's DOM has loaded (which is not working right now)</p>

<pre><code>var openEmail = function() {
    var loc = window.location.href;
    if(loc === 'http://mywebmaillogin.com:2095/') {
        var submit = document.getElementById('login_submit');
        user.value = 'myusername';
        pass.value = 'mypassword';
        if(user.value === 'myusername' &amp;&amp; pass.value === 'mypassword') {

        }

34957926,Can a TLS 1.2 server/client get by with just TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA?,"<p>I'm updating an embedded TLS 1.0 implementation to TLS 1.2 (devices with 1MB of code space or less, and no OS).  At this point, I have AES-128 and AES-256 CBC ciphers working with SHA-1 and SHA-256 digests for a minimal implementation.  The library cannot negotiate an SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 connection.</p>

<p>I felt this would be sufficient, given that RFC 5246 states, ""TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA is now the mandatory to implement cipher suite.""</p>

<p>Yet as I read various postings on security blogs, I'm seeing recommendations that would have users disable that suite, and (for example) only allow the ECDHE_RSA or DHE_RSA variants.</p>

<p>So my question is whether devices using our library will interoperate with modern web browsers (as a server) and modern https/smtps/pop servers (as a client).  <strong>Are there TLS 1.2 clients/servers that fail to negotiate a TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA connection?</strong></p>

But Go have both values and pointers for struct types which I think is confusing for developers to choose from, while java and javascript have a very simple rule: primitive types are always values, object types are always pointers.

34967795,Order of Symfony form CollectionType field,"<p>In my model I have a Recipe entity and Ingredient entity. In Recipe entity, the relation is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity=""Ingredient"", mappedBy=""recipe"", cascade={""remove"", ""persist""}, orphanRemoval=true) 
 * @ORM\OrderBy({""priority"" = ""ASC""})
 */
private $ingredients;
</code></pre>

<p>In Ingredient entity:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Recipe"", inversedBy=""ingredients"")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""recipe_id"", referencedColumnName=""id"")
 */
private $recipe;
</code></pre>

<p>I am working on CRUD controller for the recipe and I want the user to be able to add ingredients dynamically. I also want the user to drag-and-drop ingredients to set their priority (order) in the recipe. I am using CollectionType form field for this.</p>

<p>and this page as tutorial:</p>

<p><a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html</a></p>

<p>Adding and showing of the recipe are working perfectly so far, however there is a problem with Edit/Update action, which I will try to describe below:</p>

<p>In the controller, I load the entity and create the form like this:</p>

<pre><code>  public function updateAction($id, Request $request)
  {
      $em = $this-&gt;getDoctrine()-&gt;getManager();
      $recipe = $em-&gt;getRepository('AppBundle:Recipe')-&gt;find($id);


      $form = $this-&gt;createEditForm($recipe);
      $form-&gt;handleRequest($request);

      ...

    }
</code></pre>

<p>Since the priority is saved in the DB, and I have <code>@ORM\OrderBy({""priority"" = ""ASC""})</code>, the initial loading and display of ingredients works fine. However if the user drags and drops ingredients around, the priority values change. In case there are form validation errors and the form needs to be displayed repeatedly, ingredients inside the form get displayed in the old order, even though priority values are updated.</p>

<p>For example, I have the following initial Ingredient => priority values in DB:</p>

<ul>
<li>A => 1</li>
<li>B => 2</li>
<li>C => 3</li>
</ul>

<p>The form rows are displayed in order: A,B,C;</p>

<p>After user changes the order, I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>B => 1</li>
<li>A => 2</li>
<li>C => 3</li>
</ul>

<p>but the form rows are still displayed as A,B,C;</p>

<p>I understand that the form has been initialized with order A,B,C, and updating <code>priority</code> doesn't change the element order of ArrayCollection. But I have (almost) no idea how to change it.</p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<pre><code>$form-&gt;getData();
// sort in memory
$form-&gt;setData();
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work, as apparently it isn't allowed to use setData() on form which already has input.</p>

<p>I have also tried to set a DataTransformer to order the rows, but the form ignores new order.</p>

<p>I have also tried to use PRE/POST submit handlers in the FormType class to order the rows, however the form still ignores the new order.</p>

<p>The last thing that (kind of) works is this:</p>

<p>In Recipe entity, define <code>sortIngredients()</code> method which sorts ArrayCollection in memory,</p>

<pre><code>  public function sortIngredients()
  {
      $sort = \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria::create();
      $sort-&gt;orderBy(Array(
          'priority' =&gt; \Doctrine\Common\Collections\Criteria::ASC
      ));

      $this-&gt;ingredients = $this-&gt;ingredients-&gt;matching($sort);

      return $this;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in the controller:</p>

<pre><code>  $form = $this-&gt;createEditForm($recipe);
  $form-&gt;handleRequest($request);

  $recipe-&gt;sortIngredients();

  // repeatedly create and process form with already sorted ingredients
  $form = $this-&gt;createEditForm($recipe);
  $form-&gt;handleRequest($request);

  // ... do the rest of the controller stuff, flush(), etc
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but the form is created and processed twice, and honestly it looks like a hack... </p>

<p>I've read Mongooses <a href=""http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">population</a> documentation, where it has a one-to-many relationship, with one <code>Person</code> document to many <code>Story</code> documents, but the part that confuses me is where instead of the <code>Story</code> documents referencing what <code>Person</code> document it belongs to, the <code>Person</code> schema has it setup so it has an array of what <code>Story</code> documents it 'owns'.</p>

<p>I'm setting up something very similar to this. But I keep thinking it would be easier when creating new <code>Story</code> documents to have the <code>Person</code> document ID. But maybe thats just because I'm more familiar with MySQL relationships using joins.</p>

<p>If this is the best way to do it (and I'm sure it is, since its in the docs), when new <code>Story</code> documents are created, whats the best way to update the array of stories in the associated <code>People</code> document it belongs to? I looked but couldn't find any examples of updating existing documents to add references to other documents (or deleting them for that matter)</p>

<p>I'm sure this is an easy solution that I just overlooked or something, but any help would be great. Thanks!</p>

35136648,"""Where query"" creates wrong SQL on production","<p>I had to update Spring from 1.2.7 to 2.0, as well Grails from <strong>2.2.0 to 2.3.11</strong>. After solving a few typical update problems, I started to build a WAR to the testing server. Everything seemed ok. But after a few deployments I encountered a problem.</p>

<p>Sometimes (there is no rule) the server has 100% CPU usage -> OutOfMemeryError or application throws error 500. After debugging, I noticed that the reason for these problems is incorrect SQL query.</p>

<p>Where query:</p>

<pre><code>UserRole.find{role.authority =~ ""%${authTxt}"" &amp;&amp; user.id == currentUser.id}
</code></pre>

<p>creates such SQL:</p>

<pre><code>select this_.id as id1_35_2_, this_.payment_enabled as payment_2_35_2_, this_.role_id as role_id3_35_2_, this_.user_id as user_id4_35_2_,
role_alias1_.id as id1_29_0_, role_alias1_.version as version2_29_0_, role_alias1_.authority as authorit3_29_0_, user_alias2_.id as id1_36_1_,
user_alias2_.version as version2_36_1_, user_alias2_.account_expired as account_3_36_1_, user_alias2_.account_locked as account_4_36_1_, 
user_alias2_.auto_password_flag as auto_pas5_36_1_, user_alias2_.email as email6_36_1_, user_alias2_.enabled as enabled7_36_1_, 
user_alias2_.""password"" as password8_36_1_, user_alias2_.password_expired as password9_36_1_, user_alias2_.user_info_id
as user_in10_36_1_, user_alias2_.username as usernam11_36_1_ from user_role this_ inner join role role_alias1_ on this_.role_id=role_alias1_.id inner join users user_alias2_ 
on this_.user_id=user_alias2_.id where (1=1 and 1=1)
</code></pre>

<p>and here the correct SQL:</p>

<pre><code>... inner join role role_alias1_ on this_.role_id=role_alias1_.id inner join users user_alias2_ on this_.user_id=user_alias2_.id 
where ((role_alias1_.authority ilike ?) and (user_alias2_.id=?)) 
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious problem is that expression <strong>""(1 = 1 and 1 = 1)""</strong>. In fact, such query: </p>

<pre><code>User.findAll {id == userid}

<p>retrieve the entire table. <strong>Dynamic finders or criteria does not cause this problem.</strong></p>

<li>I changed the connector to Postgres from 9.0-801.jdbc3 to 9.1-901-1.jdbc4</li>
<li>I removed the dependencies to see if any of them does not cause a problem</li>
<li>I checked whether the extracted WAR does not differ in any file</li>
<li>I changed Java version</li>
<li>I changed Tomcat version</li>
<li>I tested on another system</li>

<p>From what I read on a blog which link I gave above, Graeme Rocher wrote that the problem may be due to a lack of GORM in the application. However, the problem was there during the building of WAR - dependencies were wrongly packed(?). But here the problem arises when WAR is unpacking or when classes are loading. Looking at the source of the problem from blog entry, shows that the problem may be due to some ridiculous reason ...</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea what might cause this problem or what can I debug to be able to determine the source of the error?
And the question to grails dev: what has changed between version 2.2 and 2.3 that theoretically could cause such a problem?</p>

It can make api requests and provide the results to the rest of the app through an <code>@Output</code> and <code>EventEmitter</code> but I also want a function to go the other way. The Search Bar component keeps a history of it's searches and I would like to provide a way for the parent component to clear the history. The best I can think of is to somehow call a method in my Search Bar from a parent component.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with (but haven't been able to properly implement) is to try to pass an <code>EventEmitter</code> INTO my Search Bar and the child subscribes to the parent's events. The <code>@Input</code> hasn't completed binding by the time the constructor though so it gets tricky to actually do this.</p>

<p>I suppose I could try and store the history in the parent component, but the reason the Search Bar is a component is because it will appear in multiple places and this doesn't fit with Separation of Concerns so it seems best to keep the history in the Search Bar component.</p>

I'd like to make the generated classes nicer to use in kotlin by adding extension methods. I've been told on the kotlin forums that something I could try would be to write a kotlin file that contains my extension functions. I've tried this, I used the <code>Filer</code> object to create this file outputting it to the StandardLocations.SOURCE_OUTPUT directory. Intellij can see my generated class, and I can use the extension functions as intended, but the app won't compile because the compiler can't find the new kotlin file. Is there any way I can write a new kotlin file that'll get picked up by the kotlin compiler? </p>

35174667,What architectures may be used to break up a monolithic ASP.NET website?,"<p>I want to divide up a monolithic ASP.NET MVC website into multiple websites that can be developed independently, but retain a common public URL with associated SSL certificate - and it's a single host certificate, not a wildcard.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJA2k.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJA2k.png"" alt=""Possible architecture""></a></p>

<p>The main URL for anonymous users of the public website will remain the same and will be a standard ASP.NET MVC website, though the technology used for this will be upgraded over time.</p>

<p>As to the other services, there may be quite a number of these and they may be running in the cloud, on a Raspberry Pi or something else. A lot of the response streams will be returned as text/html, though JSON will also be returned from some APIs.</p>

<p>For security, I was planning on using <a href=""https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IdentityServer</a> as a Security Token Service (STS) (probably version 4 when it settles down), so that needs to be factored in - not least authentication cookie handling.</p>

<p>I don't even know what to call what I've dubbed this front end 'distributor', but I'm assuming it's going to be lightweight. I've seen a quick demo of a node server being used in a simplistic version of this role, but I don't know enough about node to have any idea what the limitations are of this strategy.</p>

<p>Using localhost:3000 works fine, as that is what most of ActionCable defaults to. But if I try to run the rails server on port 3001, it gives me <code>Request origin not allowed: http://localhost:3001</code></p>

<p>The ActionCable docs mention using something like <code>ActionCable.server.config.allowed_request_origins = ['http://localhost:3001']</code> which does work for me if I put it in <code>config.ru</code></p>

<p>But that seems like a really weird place to put it. I feel like it should be able to go in an initializer file, or my development.rb environment config file.</p>

<p>To further prove my point that it <em>should</em> be allowed to go in there, the setting <code>ActionCable.server.config.disable_request_forgery_protection = true</code> works to ignore request origin, even when I include it in development.rb.</p>

<p>Why would <code>ActionCable.server.config.disable_request_forgery_protection</code> work in development.rb, but <code>ActionCable.server.config.allowed_request_origins</code> doesn't (but does work in config.ru)?</p>

35192712,Kubernetes Watch Pod Events with api,"<p>We are interested in running certain commands as pods and services, as they start or stop. Using the life-cycle hooks in the yml files does not work for us, since these commands are not optional. We have considered running a watcher pod that uses the watch api to run these commands. But we can't figure out how to use the watch api so that it does not keep sending the same events again and again. Is there a way to tell the watch api to only send new events since connection was opened? If expecting a stateful watch api is unreasonable, will it be possible to pass it a timestamp or a monotonically increasing id to avoid getting already seen events?</p>

<p>Basically what we are doing now we are running a pod with a daemon process that communicates with the api. we can find the events as stream. But we are interested to run some task when a pod created or deleted.</p>

35214680,AWS Mobile Push with users that may be logged into multiple devices,"<p>Our apps are being developed for both Android and iOS. We are using AWS SNS Mobile Push to push messages to both GCM and APNS. The back end is PHP and so it uses the AWS PHP SDK.</p>

<p>Until now, our system has been saving 1 Endpoint ARN per user. We then broadcast a Mobile Push message directly to this Endpoint ARN.</p>

<p>The question:</p>

<p>It would be strange if a user were logged into our app on multiple devices and did not receive push notifications on all of them. So - we're going to have to change something.</p>

<p>How, in AWS Mobile Push, is the concept of 'one user, multiple devices (and potentially multiple platforms) handled?</p>

<p>Does our system have to maintain a one-to-many association of user-to-EndpointARNs (i.e. start saving multiple EndpointARNs per user so that we may push messages to all of them sequentially)?</p>

<p>Or should I be looking into the 'Topics' concept that Mobile Push provides (I'm confused here - do some people use one topic per <em>user</em>, and then push messages to the topic itself?)..</p>

<p>Lastly - I guess as a bonus question - is it normal for people using the PHP AWS SDK to include both <code>APNS</code> <em>and</em> <code>GCM</code> attributes in the <code>Message</code> payload array? We haven't been keeping track of 'which type of device each user uses'. We've just been saving an Endpoint ARN per user. And I guess the thought was to just cover all our platform bases (APNS, APNS_SANDBOX, GCM) when we're pushing a message to an endpoint.</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of searching on the 'one user with multiple devices' topic re: Mobile Push with AWS SNS, and really the results have been quite unhelpful. </p>

<p>Help please :( </p>

<ul>
<li>semaphoreci.com: projects which are forks aren't listed even after refreshing the project list</li>
<li>app.shippable.com: signing up with both github.com and bitbucket.org doesn't work</li>

<p>I don't get why people would not want to share the CI service build commands in the VCS - chances of good collaboration without such a feature seems small to me. Even if one adds a script file in the VCS it still needs to be set up in the CI service which appears to be an unnecessary step.</p>

<p>Using Django Rest Framework I have a view where the API user can display the <code>Cart</code>, and obviously then I want to include the <code>CartItem</code> in the respone. </p>

<p>I set up my Serializer like this:</p>

<pre><code>class CartSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user = UserSerializer(read_only=True)
    cartitem_set = CartItemSerializer(read_only=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Cart

        fields = (

            'currency', 
            'cartitem_set',

<p>My problem is the second line, <code>cartitem_set = CartItemSerializer(read_only=True)</code>.</p>

<p>I get AttributeErrors saying <code>'RelatedManager' object has no attribute 'product'</code>.  ('product' is a field in the <code>CartItem</code> model.

No matter if I only leave 1 or all fields in the Serializer, I will get a error.</p>

<p>My guess is that for some reason Django REST Framework does not support adding Serializers to reverse relationships like this. Am I wrong? How should I do this?</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>The reason why I want to use the <code>CartItemSerializer()</code> is because I want to have control of what is displayed in the response.</p>

35293680,Using 'require' in angular component,"<p>According to <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component"" rel=""noreferrer"">the docs</a> (specifically, the table comparing directives to components), angular components allow requiring other directives (or is it only components?). However, components do not have a link function, which could give access to the required controller. <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/f31c5a3924629795cd9169e69b9e20efd4a9d927/src/ng/compile.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">The source</a>, contrary to documentation, seems to suggest that it is not possible to use 'require' when creating components.

35316655,How to format localised strings in Swift?,"<p>I am learning to localise my app to Simplified Chinese. I am following <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/64401/internationalization-tutorial-for-ios-2014"" rel=""noreferrer"">this tutorial</a> on how to do this.</p>

<p>Because the tutorial is based on Obj-C, formatted strings can be written like this:</p>

<pre><code>""Yesterday you sold %@ apps"" = ""Ayer le vendi&amp;oacute; %@ aplicaciones"";
</code></pre>

<p>""You like?"" = ""~Es bueno?~"";</p>

<p>But I am using Swift. And in Swift I don't think you can use <code>%@</code> to indicate that there is something to be placed there. We have string interpolation right?</p>

<p>My app is kind of related to maths. And I want to display which input(s) is used to compute the result in a detailed label of a table view cell. For example</p>

<pre><code>--------------
1234.5678
From x, y &lt;---- Here is the detailed label
--------------
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>From x, y</code> means ""The result is computed from x and y"". I want to translate this to Chinese:</p>

<pre><code>? x, y ??
</code></pre>

<p>Before, I can just use this:</p>

<pre><code>""From \(someVariable)""
</code></pre>

<p>with the strings file:</p>

<pre><code>""From"" = ""? ??"";
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how I would use it in code</p>

<pre><code>""\(NSLocalizedString(""From"", comment: """")) \(someVariable)""
</code></pre>

<p>But if this were used in the Chinese version, the final string will be like this:</p>

<pre><code>""? ?? x, y""
</code></pre>

<p>I mean I can put the <code>?</code> and <code>??</code> in two different entries in the strings file. But is there a better way to do it?</p>

35329498,How to return AJAX errors from a Laravel controller?,"<p>I am building a REST API with Laravel 5.</p>

<p>In Laravel 5, you can subclass <code>App\Http\Requests\Request</code> to define the validation rules that must be satisfied before a particular route will be processed. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Requests;

use App\Http\Requests\Request;

class BookStoreRequest extends Request {

    public function authorize() {
        return true;
    }

    public function rules() {
        return [
            'title' =&gt; 'required',
            'author_id' =&gt; 'required'
        ];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If a client loads the corresponding route via an AJAX request, and <code>BookStoreRequest</code> finds that the request doesn't satisfy the rules, it will automagically return the error(s) as a JSON object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""title"": [
    ""The title field is required.""
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the <code>Request::rules()</code> method can only validate inputand even if the input is valid, other kinds of errors could arise after the request has already been accepted and handed off to the controller. For example, let's say that the controller needs to write the new book information to a file for some reasonbut the file can't be opened:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

use App\Http\Requests;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

use App\Http\Requests\BookCreateRequest;

35345899,Why is volatile keyword not needed for thread synchronisation?,"<p>I am reading that the <code>volatile</code> keyword is not suitable for thread synchronisation and in fact it is not needed for these purposes at all.</p>

<p>While I understand that using this keyword is not sufficient, I fail to understand why is it completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>For example, assume we have two threads, thread A that only reads from a shared variable and thread B that only writes to a shared variable. Proper synchronisation by e.g. pthreads mutexes is enforced.</p>

<p>IIUC, without the volatile keyword, the compiler may look at the code of thread A and say: The variable doesnt appear to be modified here, but we have lots of reads; lets read it only once, cache the value and optimise away all subsequent reads. Also it may look at the code of thread B and say: We have lots of writes to this variable here, but no reads; so, the written values are not needed and thus lets optimise away all writes.</p>

<p>Both optimisations would be incorrect. And <del>both</del> <strong>one</strong> would be prevented by volatile. So, I would likely come to the conclusion that while <code>volatile</code> is not enough to synchronise threads, it is still necessary for any variable shared between threads. <em>(note: I now read that actually it is not required for <code>volatile</code> to prevent write elisions; so I am out of ideas how to prevent such incorrect optimisations)</em></p>

The build works fine, and gives me a green light, but when I look at the default build it has only built the binaries from the bin directory, and there seems to be no easy way to deploy the app on-premise to a local server.</p>

<p>There are two deploy options for a filesystem copy, and a powershell script, and it would certainly be easy enough to use them to copy files to a new server, but since the build only built the binaries, I don't see a tool to gather up the Web artifacts (cshtml, images, scripts, css, etc..) for this.</p>

<p><code>cat bower_components/thepackagename/bower.json | node_modules/json/lib/json.js version</code> works for some packages (assuming the npm package <code>json</code> is installed), but not all (e.g. jquery 2.2.0's bower package does not contain a bower.json).</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;Target Name=""AfterBuild""&gt;
  &lt;Exec Command=""gulp"" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, since we're still crafting this fresh project, we often extend the <code>gulpfile.js</code> to include new packages. The dev will do e.g. <code>npm install gulp-util --save-dev</code> and write a new task, and all is well.</p>

<p>The developer then checks the <code>gulpfile.js</code> and <code>packages.json</code> in to our VCS. Currently:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teamcity has an extra build step <code>npm install</code>;</li>
<li>Every developer has to run <code>npm install</code> manually;</li>
</ul>

<p>Having to <em>remember</em> something that has to be done <em>manually</em> is not a great spot to be in. At one point we had this in our <code>csproj</code> file inside the <code>Task</code>...</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code> &lt;Exec command=""npm install"" /&gt;

<p>...just before the <code>gulp</code> exec, so developers could not ""forget"" to take this manual step. However, this can take one or even multiple seconds on each (re)build, which is annoying.</p>

<p>Is there any better way to solve this? How do you handle updates to <code>packages.json</code> in projects where large(ish) teams develop using Visual Studio?</p>

35441557,How to configure Swagger/Swashbuckle custom serializer IControllerConfiguration ASP.NET WebAPI,"<p>I have a WebAPI endpoint that implements two different versions of the API (legacy and new).  The legacy endpoints use a specific Serializer that has all objects serialized as lower case words with underscores, the v2 endpoint uses camel cased property names.  For example, V1 = ""document_type"" and V2 = ""documentType""</p>

<p>This is currently achieved using controller specific attributes to define the serialization, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class CamelCaseControllerConfiguration : Attribute, IControllerConfiguration
{
    public void Initialize(HttpControllerSettings controllerSettings, HttpControllerDescriptor controllerDescriptor)

    }
}

<p>I know about IdlingResource but as I read, espresso waits out of the box till the main-thread and AsyncTaskPool is idle before running any tests.</p>

<p>For getting in touch with it I crated a simple app containing two activities, a splashscreen and a mainactivity.
The splashscreen contains something like this for waiting for three sec before starting mainActivity</p>

<pre><code> new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
   @Override
   public void run() {
     finish();
     Intent intent = new Intent(SplashScreenActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
     startActivity(intent);
   }
 }, 3000);

<p>I also tried to use AsyncTask for this but nothing seems to work correctly because every test fails.</p>

<p>The test only checks if a TextView containing a defined text is shown on the view by:</p>

<pre><code>onView(withText(""DummyText"")).check(matches(notNullValue()));
</code></pre>

<p>I thought it wouldn't be that difficult to create a simple test...</p>

<p>Because I've to test against api>=16 I need espresso. Just for me I checked it by using uiAutomator (I know it's for api >=18) but there are that smart logic to wait for something to be shown.....and that works perfectly...</p>

I have used it before when creating class objects, but I found that I don't really need it. The program would behave the same way whether or not it had a <code>this</code> keyword in front of the variable.</p>

<p>For example, these two versions of the same Circle object I created for demonstration produce the same result when used in the Test class, yet one utilizes the <code>this</code> keyword on its private variables where as the other does not.</p>

<p>Version without the <code>this</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code> public class Circle{

    private int radius;

    public Circle(){
        //default radius setting
        radius = 1;
    }

    public Circle(int r){
        radius = r;

        return radius;
    }

    public void setRadius(int r){
        radius = r;
    }
}

<p>Version with the <code>this</code> keyword: </p>

<pre><code>public class Circle{

    private int radius;

   public Circle(){
        //default radius setting
        this.radius = 1;
    }

    public Circle(int r){
        this.radius = r;

        return this.radius;
    }

    public void setRadius(int r){
        this.radius = r;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Test class I used to test both objects is:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Circle c = new Circle();
        System.out.println(c.getRadius());
        c.setRadius(6);

35506461,Is JWT Token Revocation worth it?,"<p>I previously asked a long question regarding the security of JWT tokens but I want to focus specifically on JWT token revocation here. I am using JWT as my primary authentication mechanism for authenticating mobile clients of a mobile application. My question is: Is it worth implementing token revocation? Currently, I am using a short lifetime for my tokens and I am relying on TLS to prevent tokens from being stolen by unauthorized users. I have not implemented token revocation. But basically this means that if a token is stolen somehow, there is no way to revoke it. What concerns me more is that when a user logs out of the application, the last token they were using still works if I can't revoke it. And it also means that I cannot place a limit on the number of tokens a user can request since I'm not keeping track of any tokens that are issued. I've seen many applications that just store all issued tokens in the database, allowing them to revoke and regulate tokens. But this just seems to defeat the purpose of using JWT. Is it worth adding such complexity or is my current system secure? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.</p>

35523421,AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Seeing extremely long initial connection time,"<p>For a couple of days, we often see an extremely long initial connection time (15s - 1.3 minutes) to our ELBs when making any request via ssl. 
Oddly, I was only able to observe this in Google Chrome (not Safari nor Firefox nor curl). </p>

<p>It does not occur every single request, but around 50% of requests. It occurs with the first request (OPTIONS-call).</p>

<p>Our setup is the following:
Cross-Zone ELB that connects to a node.js backend (currently in 2 AZs in eu-west-1). All instances are healthy and once the request comes through, it is processed normally. Currently, there is basically no load on the system. Cloudwatch for ELB does not report any backend connection errors, neither a  SurgeQueue (value 0) nor a spillover count. The ELB metrics show a low latency (&lt; 100 ms).
We have Route53 configured to route to the ELB (we don't see any dns trouble, see attached screenshot).</p>

<p>We have different REST-APIs that all have this setup. It occurs to all of the ELBs (each of them is connecting to an indipendent node.js backend). All of these ELBs are set up the same way via our cloudformation template.</p>

<p>The ELBs also do our SSL-termination. </p>

<p>What could lead to such a behavior? Is it possible that the ELBs are not configured properly? And why could it only appear on Google Chrome?</p>

35545598,Custom events in React Native Android native UI component,"<p>I'd like to use OpenStreetMap tiles in my React Native app on Android, so I'm trying to wrap the OSMDroid native UI component as described <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-android.html#content"" rel=""noreferrer"">here.</a> For the most part it's working fine, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to correctly handle events, specifically <code>onScroll</code> and <code>onZoom</code>. </p>

<p>With OSMDroid, you set a DelayedMapListener to handle the events, which is pretty straightforward. I've confirmed that events are being handle correctly Java-side up until the point where the JS code should be triggered. However, they're not triggering my JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-android.html#events"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>, I've implemented the event handlers in Java in the <code>createViewInstance</code> method of my view manager:</p>

<pre><code>map.setMapListener(new DelayedMapListener(new MapListener() {
    public boolean onScroll(ScrollEvent event) {
        WritableMap eventData = Arguments.createMap();

        // Fill in eventData; details not important

        ReactContext reactContext = (ReactContext)map.getContext();
        reactContext.getJSModule(RCTEventEmitter.class).receiveEvent(
            map.getId(),
            ""topChange"",
             eventData);

        return true;
    }

    public boolean onZoom(ZoomEvent event) {
        // Basically the same as above
    }
}, 100));
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant part of my JS code is basically identical to the code in the documentation linked above: </p>

<pre><code>class OSMDroidMapView extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this._onChange = this._onChange.bind(this);
    }

    _onChange(event: Event) {
        console.log(event);
        // Handle event data
    }

    render() {
        return &lt;OSMDroidMapView {...this.props} onChange={this._onChange}/&gt;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are no errors or any signs that anything is wrong. The Java event handler code is called correctly. There's just no sign of anything happening in the JS code when an event occurs. Does anyone know how to do this correctly? I feel like I must be missing some basic concept here.</p>

I am calling a soap endpoint and my service reference is generating both sync and async methods.  The call I am making, looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task DoThisAsync(idnameobject myobj, int id)
{
    await ws.DoSomethingAsync(myobj, id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am setting up my moq to return the callback, so I can interegate the parameters I have called the web service with. My test looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>var callback = new idnameobject();    

wsMock
.SetUp(w =&gt; w.DoSomethingAsync(It.IsAny&lt;idnameobject&gt;(), It.IsAny&lt;int&gt;())
.Callback&lt;idnameobject, int&gt;((obj, id) =&gt; callback = obj);

await myservice.DoThisAsync(myobj, id);

Assert.That(callback.Id, Is.EqualTo(myobj.Id));

<p>At this point, I get a null reference exception when calling my method, which doesn't contain any information in the stack trace. All I have is <code>Exception thrown: 'System.AggregateException' in mscorlib.dll</code> in the output.</p>

<p>The bit that is strange, is that it does not fail if I setup the callback from the synchronous method and change my method to call that.  </p>

<p>It also does not fail if I call an async method that only has one parameter.</p>

<p>If anyone has any ideas, please let me know as I don't want to change my method because of our tests, but ideally I want my test to ensure I am calling the web service correctly.</p>

<p><code>XmlPullParserException: Binary XML file line #17: invalid drawable tag vector</code></p>

<p>This happens when the app wants to inflate an alert dialog with a simple custom view. The custom view uses an XML file containing a <code>&lt;shape&gt;</code> tag as one of its drawable.</p>

35700344,Rest API and DDD,"<p>In my project using DDD methodology.</p>

<p>The project has the aggregate(entity) Deal. This aggregate has many of use cases.</p>

<p>For this aggregate I need to create a rest api.</p>

<p>With standard: create and delete no problem.</p>

<p>1) <strong>CreateDealUseCase</strong>(name, price and many another params);</p>

<pre><code>POST /rest/{version}/deals/
{ 
   'name': 'deal123',
   'price': 1234;
   'etc': 'etc'
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) <strong>DeleteDealUseCase</strong>(id)</p>

<pre><code>DELETE /rest/{version}/deals/{id}
</code></pre>

<p>But what to do with the rest of the use cases?</p>

<ul>
<li>HoldDealUseCase(id, reason);</li>
<li>UnholdDealUseCase(id);</li>
<li>CompleteDealUseCase(id, and many another params);</li>
<li>CancelDealUseCase(id, amercement, reason);</li>
<li>ChangePriceUseCase(id, newPrice, reason);</li>
<li>ChangeCompletionDateUseCase(id, newDate, amercement, whyChanged);</li>
<li>etc(total 20 use cases)...</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the solutions?</p>

<p>1) <strong>Use verbs</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>PUT /rest/{version}/deals/{id}/hold
{ 
   'reason': 'test'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But! Verbs can not be used in the url(in REST theory).</p>

<p>2) <strong>Use the completed state</strong>(which will be after the the use case):</p>

<pre><code>PUT /rest/{version}/deals/{id}/holded
{ 
   'reason': 'test'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Personally for me it looks ugly. Maybe I'm wrong?</p>

<p>3) <strong>Use 1 PUT request for all operations:</strong></p>

<pre><code>PUT /rest/{version}/deals/{id}
{ 
   'action': 'HoldDeal',
   'params': {'reason': 'test'}
}

PUT /rest/{version}/deals/{id}
{ 
   'action': 'UnholdDeal',
   'params': {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is difficult to handle in the backend.
Moreover, it is difficult to document. Since 1 action has many different variants of requests, from which is already dependent on specific responses.</p>

<p>All solutions have significant drawbacks.</p>

<p>I have read many articles about the REST on the internet. Everywhere only a theory, how to be here with my specific problem?</p>

35703201,speed benchmark for testing tensorflow install,"<p>I'm doubting whether tensorflow is correctly configured on my gpu box, since it's about 100x slower per iteration to train a simple linear regression model (batchsize = 32, 1500 input features, 150 output variables) on my fancy gpu machine than on my laptop. </p>

<p>I'm using a Titan X, with a modern cpu, etc. nvidia-smi says that I'm only at 10% gpu utilization, but I expect that's because of the small batchsizes. I'm not using a feed_dict to move data into the computation graph. Everything is coming via a tf.decode_csv and tf.train.shuffle_batch.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for how to easily test whether my install is correct?  Are there any simple speed benchmarks? The speed difference between my laptop and the gpu machine is so dramatic that I'm expecting that things aren't configured properly. </p>

35726616,paste grid -- expand.grid for string concatenation,"<p>If we want to get all combinations of two vectors, we can use <code>rep</code>/recycling rules:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- 1:4
y &lt;- 1:2

cbind(rep(x, each = length(y)), rep(y, length(x)))
#      [,1] [,2]

# [7,]    4    1
# [8,]    4    2

# 6    2    2
# 7    3    2
# 8    4    2

<p>Is there a simple version of this for concatenating strings? Like <code>paste.grid</code>? I have a named object where a lot of the objects have names like <code>x_y_z</code> where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> vary like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> above.</p>

<p>For example, suppose <code>x</code> can be <code>""avg""</code> or <code>""median""</code>, <code>y</code> can be <code>""male""</code> or <code>""female""</code>, and <code>z</code> can be <code>""height""</code> or <code>""weight""</code>. How can we concisely get all 8 combinations of the three?</p>

<p>Using <code>rep</code> is a pain:</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- c(""avg"", ""median"")
y &lt;- c(""male"", ""female"")
z &lt;- c(""height"", ""weight"")
paste(rep(x, each = length(y) * length(z)),
      rep(rep(y, each = length(z)), length(x)),
      rep(z, length(x) * length(y)), sep = ""_"")
</code></pre>

<p>And repurposing <code>expand.grid</code> is a bit clunky (and probably inefficient):</p>

<pre><code>apply(expand.grid(x, y, z), 1, paste, collapse = ""_"")
</code></pre>

35751736,Seeking in HTML5 video with Chrome,"<p>I'm having issues seeking in video's using Chrome.</p>

<p>For some reason, no matter what I do, <code>video.seekable.end(0)</code> is always 0.</p>

<p>When I call <code>video.currentTime = 5</code>, followed by <code>console.log(video.currentTime)</code>, I see it is always 0, which seems to reset the video.</p>

<p>I've tried both MP4 and VP9-based webm formats, but both gave the same results.</p>

<p>What's more annoying is that Firefox runs everything perfectly. Is there something special about Chrome that I should know about?</p>

<p>Here's my code (which only works in Firefox):</p>

<pre><code>      &lt;div class=""myvideo""&gt;
        &lt;video width=""500"" height=""300"" id=""video1"" preload=""auto""&gt;
          &lt;source src=""data/video1.webm"" type=""video/webm""/&gt;
          Your browser does not support videos.
        &lt;/video&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var videoDiv = $("".myvideo"").children().get(0)
videoDiv.load();
  videoDiv.addEventListener(""loadeddata"", function(){
    console.log(""loaded"");
    console.log(videoDiv.seekable.end(0)); //Why is this always 0 in Chrome, but not Firefox?
    videoDiv.currentTime = 5;
    console.log(videoDiv.currentTime); //Why is this also always 0 in Chrome, but not Firefox?
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Note that simply calling <code>videoDiv.play()</code> does actually correctly play the video in both browsers.</p>

<p>Also, after the movie file is fully loaded, the <code>videoDiv.buffered.end(0)</code> also gives correct values in both browsers.</p>

35756691,Android Support Library 23.2 vector drawables are blurry,"<p>The latest version of the Android Support Library (23.2) adds support for vector drawables. It appears to do this by rasterizing the vectors on the fly on platforms that don't natively support vector drawables.</p>

<p>However, the rasterize image seems to be a fixed size rather that dependent on usage. Here's an example.</p>

<p><strong>Vector</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;vector xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:width=""24dp""
        android:height=""24dp""

&lt;/vector&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageView
  android:layout_width=""128dp""
  android:layout_height=""128dp""
  android:id=""@+id/imageView""
  app:srcCompat=""@drawable/vector1""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The vector is 24dp x 24dp. It's used in an ImageView that's 128dp x 128dp. On platforms that's don't support vector drawables, the resulting image is blurry because the vector is rasterized at 16dp and resized to 128dp.</p>

<p>The only solution I've found is to create a separate vector drawable for each intended size. It's pretty annoying to create a bunch of duplicate vectors with only the height and width changes. And that doesn't solve the problem if you want the drawable to fill_parent or be dynamically sized in some other way.</p>

<p>Having to define the dimensions of your vector images in advanced <em>almost</em> completely defeats the benefit of using vectors in the first place.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a true work around?</p>

35780397,Understanding Service Worker scope,"<p>I am trying to implement a <code>Service Worker</code> in a test page. My end goal is an application that operates offline. The folder structure is below</p>

<pre><code>/myApp
  ...
  /static
    /mod
      /practice
        service-worker.js
        worker-directives.js
        foopage.js
  /templates
    /practice
      foopage.html
</code></pre>

<p>I am registering a service worker as shown below (within <code>service-worker.js</code>):</p>

<pre><code>navigator.serviceWorker.register('../static/mod/practice/service-worker.js').then(function(reg) {
    console.log('Registration succeeded. Scope is ' + reg.scope);
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in the console I see</p>

<p><code>Registration succeeded. Scope is https://example.com/static/mod/practice/</code></p>

<p>If my page is located at <code>https://example.com/practice/foopage</code>, do I need to make sure that my <code>service worker</code> scope is <code>https://example.com/practice/foopage</code>?</p>

<p>If I try to define the scope in the <code>register</code> function call like</p>

<pre><code>navigator.serviceWorker.register('../static/mod/practice/service-worker.js', { scope: '/practice/foopage/' }).then(function(reg) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error</p>

<pre><code>Registration failed with SecurityError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The path of the provided scope ('/practice/foopage/') is not under the max scope allowed ('/static/mod/practice/'). Adjust the scope, move the Service Worker script, or use the Service-Worker-Allowed HTTP header to allow the scope.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question is:</strong> What exactly does <em>scope</em> refer to? Is it the collection of URLs that the <code>service worker</code> will eventually control? Do I need to move <code>service-workers.js</code> somewhere else? If so, where?</p>

<p>Hi guys, I am a high school student. Now I have Grade 11 Computer Science in school.
The question is, as you see, the teacher is ask for a math contest procedure.
He said we need to do at least 10 levels.
Level 1 has one random operator.
Level 2 has two random operators
...and so on.
Also, every time the participants answer correct, he/she will get one score, which is mean I have to write something to check the correct answer. I know I need to use for loop to do the ten levels, the fact is I already tried but I can't.................I'm going crazy.</p>

<p>Plz help me..... Thanks for read it!!!</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms: print m.to_user  # let's first look what's inside ms
...
Pete Kramer
Pete Kramer
Pete Kramer
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers = []  # Create an empty list
&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms:
...     if m.to_user not in uniqueUsers:
...         uniqueUsers.append(m.to_user)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers
[Pete Kramer]  # This is what I would expect
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers = {}  # Now let's create a dict
&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms:
...     if m.to_user not in uniqueUsers:
...         uniqueUsers[m.to_user] = 1
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers
{Pete Kramer: 1, Pete Kramer: 1, Pete Kramer: 1}
</code></pre>

<p>So I tested it by converting the dict to a list when doing the if statement, and that works as I would expect it to:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for m in ms:
...     if m.to_user not in list(uniqueUsers):
...         uniqueUsers[m.to_user] = 1
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniqueUsers
{Pete Kramer: 1}
</code></pre>

<p>and I can get a similar result by testing against <code>uniqueUsers.keys()</code>. </p>

<p>The thing is that I don't understand why this difference occurs. I always thought that if you do <code>if object in dict</code>, it simply creates a list of the dicts keys and tests agains that, but that's obviously not the case.</p>

<p>Can anybody explain how <code>object in dict</code> internally works and why it doesn't behave similar to <code>object in list</code> (as I would expect it to)?</p>

35848266,"Using Laravel's Mailgun driver, how do you (gracefully) send custom data and tags with your email?","<p>So I'm using Laravel 5.1 and trying to integrate with Mailgun.  Well, that's easy, but now I'm trying to send <a href=""https://documentation.mailgun.com/user_manual.html#attaching-data-to-messages"" rel=""noreferrer"">custom variables</a> from my application along with my emails.</p>

<p>I'm actually switching our application over from Mandrill because of their ""new direction"" and such.  With them, I could supply the variables and tags via the email headers, but with Mailgun, that only works when you send via SMTP.  In Laravel, <code>Mail::send()</code> uses an API call, so in theory I'd add the metadata there with <code>""v:my-custom-data"" =&gt; ""{""this_id"": 123}""</code>, but I'd like to avoid altering core classes like that.</p>

<p>I also considered using <a href=""https://github.com/Bogardo/Mailgun"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bogardo/Mailgun</a>, but then I'd have to replace all the <code>Mail::send()</code>s with <code>Mailgun::send()</code>, and then I couldn't send emails locally (environment based email driver), and then the application would be ""married"" to Mailgun.</p>

<p>Anyone done this before?  Please let me know if I'm not clear here.</p>

35863819,Non-SPA with angular2,"<p>I started using angular2 (with an express.js backend) with the intention of passing control of several sections of a page to angular2 components, but I eventually realized that the system is much  more effective when angular2 controls an entire area of a page. However, my application is not a SPA and there are other server-rendered routes aside from the route that holds the selector of my angular2 root component. </p>

<p>I have 2 questions, followed by code snippets:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whenever I load a server-controlled route whose server-side rendered template does not contain the selector of my root component, <code>&lt;main-comp&gt;&lt;/main-comp&gt;</code>, angular2 basically pukes into the console saying it doesn't have anywhere to initialize. I put all of my angular2 initialization code in a shared header for my whole application. Is there a way to tell the angular2 root component not to render itself if its selector simply does not exist on the page?</p></li>
<li><p>The server side route that renders the angular2 root component is <code>/writing</code> and the angular2 routing URL for a particular blog post would be something like <code>/writing/2016/03/post</code>. However, whenever I browse straight to the URL, System.js tries to load app/boot relative to that location, i.e., <code>/writing/2016/03/app/boot</code>, which obviously fails with a 404. I think this is happening because my server controls the <code>/writing</code> route and angular loads relative to the base URL being requested to the server. Thus, the only solution I know of would be to turn my application into an SPA with a single server route being <code>'/'</code>, which would require lots of rewriting to the front end. How can I get around this issue?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is my root component:</p>

<pre><code>@Component({
    selector: 'main-comp',
    template: '&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;',
    providers: [TagService, PostService, BlogStateService],

<p>So far, the only difference I've found between the two is that <code>AbsoluteUri</code> will fail for relative uris (e. g. <code>new Uri(""foo"", UriKind.Relative).AbsoluteUri</code>).

35947434,Redux reducers -- changing deeply-nested state,"<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around how to change deeply-nested state in redux. It makes sense to me to combine reducers and change first-level properties of the state for those pieces. Where I'm not so clear is on how to change the state of a deeply-nested property.
Let's pretend that I have a shopping cart app. Below is my state:    </p>

<pre><code>{
    cart: {
      items: []
    },
    account: {
      amountLeft: 100,
      discounts: {
        redeemed: [],
        coupons: {
          buyOneGetOne: false
        }
      }
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a user enters in a code, let's say they can redeem the ""buyOneGetOne"" coupon and that value should become true. 
I have a reducer for cart and another for account. For a first-level property (like if I was clearing the cart's items), I would just do the following in my reducer:</p>

<pre><code>case 'EMPTY_CART':
  return Object.assign({}, state, {items: []});
</code></pre>

<p>For changing buyOneGetOne, however, it seems like I would first need to do an Object.assign on coupons (because buyOneGetOne was modified), then doing an Object.assign on discounts (because I had modified coupons), and then finally emitting the action so the reducer could do Object.assign on the account (because discounts has now changed). This seems really complicated and easy to do wrong, though, which leads me to believe there must be a better way.</p>

<p>Am I going about this all wrong? It seems like reducers are only used to modify the root level properties of the state (like cart and account) and that I shouldn't have a reducer that touches state inside the account (like a discounts reducer), because account already has a reducer. But when I only want to change one property far down the state tree, it gets complex to merge every object from that change all the way up the object chain to the child of the root...</p>

<p>Can you/should you have reducers inside of reducers, like in this case have a discounts reducer?</p>

35966085,Image Loading Android,"<p>I have an android app which loads large amounts of images from my online SQL database and displays them to the user. The way I am currently handling this is I load the initial 10 images when the user presses the button, then I start displaying these 10 images to him and in the background run a <code>TimerTask</code> which executes every <code>2000ms</code> and loads the next 10 images until all images have been loaded. The problem with this is that even though I call <code>timer.cancel()</code> when the user leaves the slideshow, the timer still unnecessarily loads some images according to the logs (I think the logs are delayed a bit due to the images being downloaded). Also, I cannot execute any other HTTP requests in the time the images are being loaded. My goal is to deliver an experience to the user where he doesn't have to wait too long to start viewing the photos (downloading all of them at once is out of the question) but also I do not want the background downloading to interfere in any way with his usage of the app. My goal is to achieve something like Snapchat offers with its stories, where a few images are preloaded allowing the user to start viewing them and I assume the rest are loaded in the background. What is the best way to achieve something like this?</p>

35971042,"How to correctly use ES6 ""export default"" with CommonJS ""require""?","<p>I've been working through <a href=""http://blog.madewithlove.be/post/webpack-your-bags/"">Webpack tutorial</a>. In one of the sections, it gives the code example that contains one line of essence to this question:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>export default class Button { /* class code here */ }
</code></pre>

<p>In the next section of said tutorial, titled ""Code splitting"", the class defined above is loaded on demand, like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>require.ensure([], () =&gt; {
    const Button = require(""./Components/Button"");
    const button = new Button(""google.com"");
    // ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this code throws an exception:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Button is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I know that the <em>right</em> way to include ES6 module would be to simply <code>import Button from './Components/Button';</code> at the top of the file, but using a construct like that anywhere else in the file makes babel a sad panda:</p>

<pre><code>SyntaxError: index.js: 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level
</code></pre>

<p>After some fiddling with previous (<code>require.ensure()</code>) example above, I realized that ES6 <code>export default</code> syntax exports an object that has property named <code>default</code>, which contains my code (the <code>Button</code> function).</p>

<p>I did fix the broken code example by appending <code>.default</code> after require call, like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>const Button = require(""./Components/Button"").default;
</code></pre>

<p>...but I think it looks a bit clumsy and it is error-prone (I'd have to know which module uses ES6 syntax, and which uses good old <code>module.exports</code>).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my question: <strong>what is the right way to import ES6 code from code that uses CommonJS syntax?</strong></p>

<p>A weird thing happening is that it seems like every time I visit <code>localhost:8000</code>, the counter goes up by 3. So I'd go to <code>localhost:8000/count</code> and the <code>counter</code> would be at 3, and then I visit <code>localhost:8000</code>, and then <code>localhost:8000/count</code> again, <code>counter</code> would now be at 6. Why does that happen? Is there something weird with <code>net/http</code>?</p>

<p>Also, why is it that when I refresh <code>localhost:8000/count</code>, the count goes up 1 by 1? The <code>counter</code> func doesn't increment <code>count</code>, yet <code>count</code> still goes up - why is that? Does <code>handler</code> get added to the <code>localhost:8000/count</code> route as well? </p>

API's mostly look synchronous to me, and when watching presentations on Go, its not uncommon to hear comments like ""and the call blocks""</p>

<p>Is Go using blocking IO when reading from files or network?
Or is there some kind of magic that re-writes the code when used from inside a Go Routine?</p>

<p>Coming from a C# background, this feels very non intuitive, in C# we have the <code>await</code> keyword when consuming async API's.
Which clearly communicates that the API can yield the current thread and continue later inside a continuation.</p>

<p>So TLDR;
Will Go block the current thread when doing IO inside a Go routine, or will it be transformed into a C# like async await state machine using continuations?</p>

We are talking like 30-45 seconds for the first request and 3 seconds for each new view. Our MVC application is using our OData API (Web API) which is located on the same server. Besides the same performance issues as the MVC application, the first query to entity framework version 6 is executing in 6 seconds and new queries is executing 200ms slower than subsequent queries.</p>

<p>In order to meet our requirements, we have chosen to execute all known Ef queries and hit all our MVC/API endpoints from Application_Start in Global.asax. This seems to work fine for at least a couple of hours, but after some time without use, the first request to every MVC view is responding in 3-5 seconds.</p>

<p>We have configured the websites to be ""Always on"" and we have not found anything in the IIS logs or the logging we've added to Application_Start. So it seems our applications are at least not recycling. I suspect some kind of IIS cache being cleared or maybe some Ef cache? Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

36118235,Function definition: fun vs val,"<p>I'm curious about what is the suggested way to define member functions in Kotlin. Consider these two member functions:</p>

<pre><code>class A {

  fun f(x: Int) = 42

  val g = fun(x: Int) = 42

}
</code></pre>

<p>These appear to accomplish the same thing, but I found subtle differences.</p>

<p>The <code>val</code> based definition, for instance, seems to be more flexible in some scenarios. That is, I could not work out a straight forward way to compose <code>f</code> with other functions, but I could with <code>g</code>. To toy around with these definitions, I used the <a href=""https://github.com/MarioAriasC/funKTionale"">funKTionale</a> library. I found that this does not compile:</p>

<pre><code>val z = g andThen A::f // f is a member function
</code></pre>

<p>But if <code>f</code> were defined as a <code>val</code> pointing to the same function, it would compile just fine. To figure out what was going on I asked IntelliJ to explicitly define the type of <code>::f</code> and <code>g</code> for me, and it gives me this:</p>

<pre><code>val fref: KFunction1&lt;Int, Int&gt; = ::f

val gref: (Int) -&gt; Int = g
</code></pre>

<p>So one is of type <code>KFunction1&lt;Int, Int&gt;</code>, the other is of type <code>(Int) -&gt; Int</code>. It's easy to see that both represent functions of type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>.</p>

<p>What is the difference between these two types, and in which cases does it matter? I noticed that for top-level functions, I can compose them fine using either definition, but in order to make the aforementioned composition compile, I had to write it like so:</p>

<pre><code>val z = g andThen A::f.partially1(this)
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. I had to partially apply it to <code>this</code> first.</p>

<p>Since I don't have to go through this hassle when using <code>val</code>s for functions, is there a reason why I should ever define non-Unit member functions using <code>fun</code>? Is there a difference in performance or semantics that I am missing?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>For Noda Time 2.0, I've moved everything over to DNX/DNU (soon to be dotnet cli, of course). However, we now want to build a regularly-updated package containing the latest time zone information from <a href=""https://www.iana.org/time-zones"">IANA</a>. We'll build one version of that with a dependency on Noda Time 1.3.1, and another version with a dependency on Noda Time 2.0.0.</p>

<p>I would <em>like</em> to do all of this still within DNX/DNU, but it's unclear to me whether there's any way of telling DNX/DNU about this target framework. Note that I want to make this available to all current users of 1.3.1, and it also depends on 1.3.1, so I believe the set of target frameworks basically needs to be identical.</p>

<p>I've tried frameworks of:</p>

<ul>
<li>portable-net40+sl5+win8+wpa81+wp8 (which I expected to have the best chance of working based on the <a href=""https://docs.nuget.org/create/targetframeworks"">Nuget documentation</a>)</li>
<li>portable-net4+sl5+netcore45+wpa81+wp8+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1+XamariniOS1</li>
<li>Profile328 </li>
</ul>

<p>In every case, <code>dnu restore</code> shows an error of this form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""portable-net40+sl5+win8+wpa81+wp8"" is an unsupported framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a horrible suspicion that this basically isn't a supported use case, and that I'll need to stick to a regular csproj file for this particular part, but I thought it worth asking to see if I'm missing something.</p>

36161832,Why does PyCharm sometimes not use system environment variable for PATH with a virtual environment?,"<p>Using PyCharm, I have configured a virtual environment. This results in some really confusing interactions with PATH. When I look at the environment variable for PATH that a file has:</p>

<pre><code>print '##### PATH'
print os.environ['PATH']
</code></pre>

<p>I see the following output:</p>

<pre><code>##### PATH
 /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/username/.virtualenvs/venv/bin
</code></pre>

<p>This confuses me because I have explicitly told PyCharm to use system environment variables through the following dialog:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rbOmc.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rbOmc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When clicking ""Show"" I see that PATH is defined differently:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sp45x.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sp45x.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What I do not understand is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Running PyCharm from a shell using <code>charm</code> results in PATH being successfully set:</p>

<pre><code>##### PATH
/Users/username/.virtualenvs/username/bin:/Users/username/go/dependencies/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/bin:.... etc
</code></pre>

<p>This is without any other configuration taking place in PyCharm - simply relaunching it from a shell causes PATH to behave set differently</p></li>
<li><p>I can also manually define the PATH variable in PyCharm (to the value given in the parent environment variables tab) and it works fine, too</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But for some reason PyCharm is not pulling the PATH variable from my parent environment variables even though it is present and <em>appears</em> to be included properly (without either of the above two workarounds).</p>

<p>Why is PyCharm doing this and what do I need to do to actually ""include parent environment variables"" correctly?</p>

<p>I am using PyCharm 5.0.4 on OS:X with a bash shell.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve, is this:</p>

<p>The customer visits the website, and gets a text box where they enter their car's license plate number. This will then return a price for a specific repair. </p>

<p>I want to achieve this by adding the license plate number to the below URI (in this example, 1-KBB-00 is the license plate number).</p>

<pre><code>https://www.finnik.nl/autorapport/1-KBB-00
</code></pre>

<p>This url returns a webpage with a large table listing all kinds of specifications belonging to this car. The one I'm looking for is:</p>

<pre><code> Aantal versnellingen 
</code></pre>

<p>which in this example has a value of ""5"". On the website that belongs to the mentioned URI, this looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope=""row"" class=""col-sm-8""&gt;
          Aantal versnellingen
        &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
5
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For virtually all cars, this value will be either 5 or 6. I want the script to scrape or get this value, and then apply an if/else command to display the price. In case the value is 5, the price is ""X"", if the value is 6, the price is ""Y"" and if the value is anything else than 5 or 6, the script will return an error message telling the customer to contact the company in order to get a quote. </p>

<p>Now I'm able to implement the if/else part of the script myself, and appending the license plate to the url shouldn't be an issue either, but I'm at a loss when it comes to scraping the data from this table.</p>

<p>I've optimistically tried to use a 'get' command, but unsurprisingly that didn't work. I've googled my eyes out, but I haven't been able to find a proper solution, and a part of me is wondering if this is even possible.

36193250,Android 6.0 (Marshmallow): How to play midi notes?,"<p>I'm creating an app that generates live instrument sounds and I'm planning on using the new Midi API featured in Android Marshmallow (version 6.0). I've read the package overview document here <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/midi/package-summary.html"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/midi/package-summary.html</a> and I know how to generate Midi notes but i'm still unsure: how do I actually play these notes after I've generated their Midi data?</p>

<p>Do I need a synthesizer program to play Midi notes? If so, do I have to make my own or is one provided by Android or a 3rd party?</p>

<p>I am a novice with Midi so please be as descriptive as possible with your answer. </p>

<p><strong>What i've tried so far:</strong> 
I've created a Midi manager object and opened an input port</p>

<pre><code>MidiManager m = (MidiManager)context.getSystemService(Context.MIDI_SERVICE); 
MidiInputPort inputPort = device.openInputPort(index);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, i've sent a test noteOn midi message to the port </p>

<pre><code>byte[] buffer = new byte[32];
int numBytes = 0;
int channel = 3; // MIDI channels 1-16 are encoded as 0-15.
buffer[numBytes++] = (byte)(0x90 + (channel - 1)); // note on
buffer[numBytes++] = (byte)60; // pitch is middle C
buffer[numBytes++] = (byte)127; // max velocity
int offset = 0;
// post is non-blocking
inputPort.send(buffer, offset, numBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>I've also set up a class to receive the midi note messages </p>

<pre><code>class MyReceiver extends MidiReceiver {
    public void onSend(byte[] data, int offset,
            int count, long timestamp) throws IOException {
        // parse MIDI or whatever
    }
}
MidiOutputPort outputPort = device.openOutputPort(index);
outputPort.connect(new MyReceiver());
</code></pre>

<p>Now, here's where i'm most confused. The use case of my app is to be an all-in-one composition &amp; playback tool for making music. In other words, my app needs to contain or use a virtual midi device (like an intent of another app's midi synthesizer). Unless someone already made such a synthesizer, I must create one myself within my app's lifecycle. How do I actually actually convert a received midi noteOn() into sound coming out of my speakers? I'm especially confused because there also has to be a way to programmatically decide what type of instrument the note sounds like it's coming from: is this also done in a synthesizer?</p>

<p>Midi support in Android Marshmallow is fairly new so I haven't been able to find any tutorials or sample synthesizer apps online. Any insight is appreciated.</p>

36200307,Event Sourcing and optimistic concurrency control,"<p>When you want code works under race conditions, commonly developers uses <strong>Optimistic concurrency control</strong> (OCC). From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...before committing, each transaction verifies that no other
  transaction has modified the data it has read. If the check reveals
  conflicting modifications, the committing transaction rolls back...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An approach to implement OCC is checking a <code>version</code> of the data to be modified. If the version differs, then other transactions have modified the data and the it's up to the application to decide how it should resolve the conflict (reattempt, notify user...). </p>

<p>A draft would be as following:</p>

<pre><code>class Repository
{
    public class save($data)
    {
        $currentVersion = $data-&gt;version;
        $data-&gt;version  = $currentVersion + 1;

        $result = $this-&gt;db-&gt;update($data, [
            'id'        =&gt; $data-&gt;id,
            'version'   =&gt; $currentVersion
        ]);

        if (1 === $result) {
            // everything ok
        } else {
            // conflict!
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, as in <code>EventSourcing</code> we only <strong>append</strong> all events that occurs in the domain, we can't no longer use this approach to implement OCC. Which are other approaches to keep OOC while using EventSourcing?</p>

<p>An option that could works, it's lookup for conflicting events when store them. This approach allow a fine grained control over the events. I don't know if this will over complicated the solution or it's a ""standard"" that I think is pointed out at <a href=""http://danielwhittaker.me/2014/09/29/handling-concurrency-issues-cqrs-event-sourced-system/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://danielwhittaker.me/2014/09/29/handling-concurrency-issues-cqrs-event-sourced-system/</a></p>

36204515,VS Project References Broken On Case Sensitivity of GUID,"<p>Since upgrading to VS 2015, my team has experienced random quirky things which I'm sure are being worked out at Microsoft right now.  One pretty annoying one is that we seem to lose project references, especially after branching.  I began to work on a new branch of our solution yesterday only to find out that types were unrecognized and namespace usings were being cited as unnecessary (because they were for the types that had suddenly become unrecognized).</p>

<p>The references in the project did not show any icons indicating a problem with the reference, but just to see if it would work, I removed and re-added a project reference, which caused its types to be recognized once more.</p>

<p>This, of course, updated the project file, so I looked to see what changes had been made.  The only difference between the project that could not detect the reference and the one that now can is that the alpha characters in the GUID had been changed from lower case to upper case.  For example:</p>

<p>Old, broken reference:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ProjectReference Include=""path/redacted""&gt;
    &lt;Project&gt;{95d34b2e-2ceb-499e-ab9e-b644b0af710d}&lt;/Project&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;Project.Name.Redacted&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/ProjectReference&gt;

<p>New, fixed reference:</p>

    &lt;Name&gt;Project.Name.Redacted&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/ProjectReference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking for the reason this is happening and how I might fix it without having to manually remove and re-add references all over the place (and without having to convert all the project file GUIDs to upper case).</p>

<p>I should note that these ""broken"" references are not breaking the build, and that they only show up in the Error List as IntelliSense error, not build errors.  So, the references aren't really broken, they've just broken IntelliSense (which is arguably worse?!).</p>

36205850,sklearn pipeline - Applying sample weights after applying a polynomial feature transformation in a pipeline,"<p>I want to apply sample weights and at the same time use a pipeline from sklearn which should make a feature transformation, e.g. polynomial, and then apply a regressor, e.g. ExtraTrees.</p>

<p>I am using the following packages in the two examples below:</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesRegressor
import numpy as np
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works well as long as I seperately transform the features and generate and train the model afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>#Feature generation
X = np.random.rand(200,4)
Y = np.random.rand(200)

#Feature transformation
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
poly.fit_transform(X)

#Model generation and fit
clf = ExtraTreesRegressor(n_estimators=5, max_depth = 3)
weights = [1]*100 + [2]*100
clf.fit(X,Y, weights)
</code></pre>

<p>But doing it in a pipeline, does not work:</p>

<pre><code>#Pipeline generation
pipe = Pipeline([('poly2', PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)), ('ExtraTrees', ExtraTreesRegressor(n_estimators=5, max_depth = 3))])

#Feature generation
X = np.random.rand(200,4)
Y = np.random.rand(200)

#Fitting model
clf = pipe
weights = [1]*100 + [2]*100
clf.fit(X,Y, weights)
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following error: TypeError: fit() takes at most 3 arguments (4 given)
In this simple example, it is no issue to modify the code, but when I want to run several different tests on my real data in my real code, being able to use pipelines and sample weight</p>

The plots look great and easy to generate, but one problem that I'm having some trouble with is having the fine control on the font size in the plots. </p>

<p>My font size in my paper is 9pt and I would like to make sure the font size in my plots are either 9pt or 10pt. But in seaborn, the font size is mainly controlled through font scale <code>sns.set_context(""paper"", font_scale=0.9)</code>. So it's hard for me to find the right font size except through trial and error. Is there a more efficient way to do this?</p>

<p>I also want to make sure the font size is consistent between different seaborn plots. But not all my seaborn plots have the same dimension, so it seems like using the <em>same font_scale</em> on all the plots does not necessarily create the same font size across these different plots?</p>

<p>I've attached my code below. I appreciate any comments on how to format the plot for a two column academic paper. My goal is to be able to control the size of the figure without distorting the font size or the plot. I use Latex to write my paper. </p>

I've been reading about those 3 technologies, to solve a very specific problem. <strong>I want to avoid this in my HTML file (part of an AngularJS application)</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""some-file.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""some-file2.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""some-file3.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Dozens of similar lines here... --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, <strong>the order of those lines in my HTML file matters</strong>. Bootstrap will ask for jQuery, etc. </p>

<p>First thing I found: requirejs. You just specify something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""my-bundled-file.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then, you solve the dependency problem with JS. Going further, I found 2 approaches here:</p>

<ul>
<li>CommonJS (browserify)</li>
<li>AMD (require.js)</li>
</ul>

<p>Webpack works with both approaches, which sounds nice.</p>

<p>At the end, the 3 tools can be used for the same thing: <strong>bundle several files in only one</strong>. But what I'm worried about is <strong>the order in which those files are bundled</strong>. </p>

<p>I don't want to care about this, and looks like using those solutions (or even gulp + gulp-concat, like is suggested <a href=""https://medium.com/@dickeyxxx/best-practices-for-building-angular-js-apps-266c1a4a6917#.v0t56k8rb"">here</a>), <strong>I'm just moving the problem: now, I specify the modules which my application uses with JS code, but I still need to put the modules in the correct order</strong>, even with WebPack (an example <a href=""http://www.shmck.com/webpack-angular-part-2/"">here</a>: <code>require</code> calls must be in the correct order)</p>

<p>So, my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>am I misunderstanding these tools? I just want to solve the loading order problem, and looks like I'm not doing it</strong></li>
<li><strong>do these tools solve a different problem (lack of native modules in ES5, which drives to contaminate the global scope)?</strong></li>
</ul>

36233309,React.js Serverside rendering and Event Handlers,"<p>I am learning to use react.js and have some issues to use the event handlers. The final question would be: Is it possible to use server side rendering and send event handlers to the client automaticly?</p>

<p>Here is my example:
I have an index.jsx which I render server side and send to the client</p>

<pre><code>var React = require(""react"");
var DefaultLayout = require(""./layout/default"");

var LikeButton = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {liked: false}; 
  }, 
  handleClick: function(event) {
    this.setState({liked: !this.state.liked});
  }, 
  render: function() {
    var text = this.state.liked ? 'like' : 'haven\'t liked';
    return (
      &lt;p onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
        You {text} this. Click to toggle.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    );
  } 
});

var IndexComponent = React.createClass({
   render: function(){
       return (
           &lt;DefaultLayout title={this.props.name}&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;React Test&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div id=""testButton""&gt;
                    &lt;LikeButton/&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt; 

                &lt;script type=""text/babel"" src=""/js/react.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
           &lt;/DefaultLayout&gt;
       )
   }   
});
</code></pre>

<p>But the ""Like Button"" does not have any interaction. To make it do something on click I have to add this code client side.</p>

<pre><code>var LikeButton = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {liked: false};
  },
  handleClick: function(event) {
    this.setState({liked: !this.state.liked});
  },
  render: function() {
    var text = this.state.liked ? 'like' : 'haven\'t liked';
    return (
      &lt;p onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
        You {text} this. Click to toggle.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    );
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;LikeButton /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('testButton')
);
</code></pre>

<p>I only started out with react.js and maybe I am just missing some major concept here. But why does react.js not just create the code (which I now have to add manually to the client) when rendering the page server side?
Like this, I have redundant code and it feels like this will be a mess in larger applications. 
At least react.js is smart enough to not draw two LikeButtons but to ""bind"" the one created server side to the client side component. </p>

36238792,Electron app from dvd poor loading performance,"<p>We just finished building an electron application with node and react. The application is running smooth on every platform and we are pretty happy of the result. 
Now we received the request  to distribute a version of that app on dvd (meaning that we need to run the application directly from the disc without installing it on the local drive) so we just burn it and tried to launch it.
The app is working fine but the problem is the loading time as it takes almost 2 minutes to have the app running without any feedback to the end user.
This is caused by the overhead for loading a large number of files which is very slow from the optical drive.
So we need some ideas to speed up things or at least to have something to show to the user during the loading time. 
This could be a launcher application with a splash screen but it must run on mac, win and linux.
We thought at QT, but we'd like something less complicated..</p>

36270671,How to patch OpenJDK 9 with Jigsaw integrated?,"<p>Before Jigsaw it was quite easy to replace one or several classes in OpenJDK (to perform some test or make a contribution). I could copy an original file from OpenJDK source, for example, <code>java/util/ArrayList.java</code> into <code>src/java/util/</code>, add any changes I want, then compile it normally (outputting to <code>mypatch</code> directory):</p>

<pre><code>$ javac.exe src\java\util\ArrayList.java -d mypatch
</code></pre>

<p>After that I could launch JVM with <code>-Xbootclasspath/p</code> to replace original <code>ArrayList</code> with the patched one:</p>

<pre><code>$ java -Xbootclasspath/p:mypatch MyTestClass
</code></pre>

<p>However this does not work anymore since Jigsaw integration in Java 9-ea+111. The compilation command reports tons of errors starting like this:</p>

<pre><code>src\java\util\ArrayList.java:26: error: package exists in another module: java.base
package java.util;
^
src\java\util\ArrayList.java:108: error: cannot find symbol
public class ArrayList&lt;E&gt; extends AbstractList&lt;E&gt;
                                  ^

        implements List&lt;E&gt;, RandomAccess, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
                   ^
</code></pre>

<p>And even if I compile with older JDK, then JVM cannot start:</p>

<pre><code>-Xbootclasspath/p is no longer a supported option.

36357081,MVC vs. Active Record vs. Factory,"<p>The active record pattern is an approach to accessing data in a database. A database table or view is wrapped into a class. Thus, an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon save.</p>

<p>MVC is a framework for building web applications using a MVC (Model View Controller) design: The Model represents the application core (for instance a list of database records). The View displays the data (the database records).</p>

<p>In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.</p>

<p>What are the benefits of using MVC comparing to Active Record ?  </p>

<p>In my website i used a combination of Active Record &amp; Factory patterns. For me, it's more simple and faster to use these because i just need to write some functions. Also, i don't need a view, a model or something else. I mean in my opinion, the more i'm bounded to rules, the more designing becomes complicated.   </p>

<p>But if what i say is correct, why there are too many frameworks that use MVC ?</p>

These computers can access shared folders on other computers in the network by logging with user accounts that exist on those computers.  With me so far?</p>

<p>Problem: I've set up a VPN through the router (netgear router with openvpn client), and I can see the shared folders on ""Most"" computers.  I'm using Windows XP Professional, and inside the VPN I can access computers that are Windows XP or newer.  I'm getting a local IP address from the router's DHCP and all that seems perfect.  But I'm having I'm having problems accessing Windows 2000 computers.  I try to log in and receive the error ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"". I'm typing the correct username and password, and just can't figure out why it's not working.  </p>

<p>I'm using Wireshark to analyze the packets and can't really see anything in there that is that much different in the SMB communication between these machines, and I'm not really sure where to start.  Since XP machines in the same office behind the same router can access Windows 2000 machines, but I can't through the VPN, it seems the problem might have something to do with that.  Any tips on how to trouble-shoot this?</p>

i want something to make my git and docker hookup easier. what tools are there?</p>

<p>LONG:
you can use jenkins to watch a git repo. jenkins runs your build script and your test suite and then does a docker push.
but after the push nothing happens! you pull manually.</p>

<p>on github you can use travis in a similar manner (if travis now supports docker). for those not in the know, think of travis as ""jenkins online"" but after doing its thing it destroys the build environment - any artifacts etc must be sent somewhere else prior to destruction.
BUT I still need to pull manually.</p>

<p>finally, you can do docker automated builds. However, now I've lost control since even if my build fails the docker build still kicks off!</p>

<p>Hello, everyone!</p>

<p>What I want to do is, in other words, is a sound recognition with ""wide-range"". i.e. if there is a sound ""Boom! Boom!"" then I don't really have to recognize that such as,
 ""Okay, that is a certain engine sound from Chevrolet Corvette Z06. Nice machine, huh?"" (X)
 but rather to recognize that as something like,
 ""Car. Coming to me. Loud and Noisy."" (O) This is enough.</p>

<p>or, if there is a sound ""Ka-boom!"" ""Bang!"", I don't have to recognize it as,
 ""Firework play at the north bridge. In this winter? Maybe some retarded are out there."" (X)
 but,
 ""Fire boom. I would never go there. Strange."" (O)
this is enough.
...
and so on. That is, I want to 'categorize' sounds with the anonymous library and use it as a useful information for guidelines given by my app.</p>

<p>Is there any helpful information, or recommendable libraries I can refer to? I would be awaiting your great advice. Thank you.</p>

 I have a really simple PDO wrapper but I feel it is still too much trouble for the user to write all the sql queries themselves.

If not, then can someone provide me with a simple good ORM example?</p>

36477450,even basic Ionic project with Cordova WKWebview Engine plugin produces white screen,"<p><strong>My problem:</strong>
The ionic app I'm developing is horribly slow, after finding out UIWebView is the culprit I'm looking for ways to speed it up, with WKWebView being the most promising solution. </p>

<p><strong>What my project looks like:</strong>
When setting up a sample ionic project (<a href=""http://ccoenraets.github.io/ionic-tutorial/install-ionic.html"">http://ccoenraets.github.io/ionic-tutorial/install-ionic.html</a> for example) with the current Cordova 4.1.0 CLI (i'm using Ionic 1.2.4) UIWebView is used as default. However, since Cordova 4, the new and faster WKWebView is supported out-of-the-box and can be forced, at least in iOS 9 (<a href=""https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine"">cordova 4 supports WKWebView</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The plugin I used &amp; configured:</strong>
via <code>cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine</code> the support is added for the iOS platform (9.3 right now). When this plugin is added and properly configured in the config.xml with</p>

<p><code>&lt;feature name=""CDVWKWebViewEngine""&gt;
    &lt;param name=""ios-package"" value=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"" /&gt;
 &lt;/feature&gt;
 &lt;preference name=""CordovaWebViewEngine"" value=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"" /&gt;</code></p>

<p><strong>What I tried so far:</strong>
In the terminal <code>ionic build ios</code>, then build succeeds, and when installing the app via XCode 7.3 on OS X El Capitan 10.11.3 in the console log the <code>Using WKWebView</code> message is printed but then, right after the splashscreen, the app container fades into a white screen of death. As soon as I remove that plugin, UIWebView is used and the app works as expected.</p>

<p><em>Alternative</em>: replacing the original plugin <a href=""https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/wkwebview-engine-localhost"">wkwebview-engine-localhost</a> with one with integrated localhost, works. As I understood, the WKWebview should be supported by cordova and ionic right out of the box, without having to rely on some ""labs plugin"" with an integrated server, which was developed to support iOS 8 which I don't need. I understand that WKWebView has quite some limitations compared to the old UIWebView, especially when it comes to handling <code>file://</code> statements <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-10967?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20wkwebview-known-issues"">known issues</a>, but there for sure must be someone out there who got Ionic + Cordova WKWebView working without all the hassle I had, right? There must be better ways to achieving a simple speed improvement for the webview.</p>

<p>I tried probably every solution, config, plugin combination, cordova cli version downgrade (minimum being 4.0.0 for WKWebView support), clearing caches and resetting and restarting of my device, new install and readding of platforms and update of cordova, npm, various plugins, but all of them either didn't help at all except for the apache labs plugin above or seemed like a huge mess that didn't change anything.</p>

<p>When remote debugging the ios app on the device via my local Safari, I can see in the elements tree, that the body tag stays either empty, or a simple ""ng-view"" placeholder for an angular element is shown. Am I correct that there must be a problem with the retrieval of files/angular scripts through the way cordova via WKWwebView handles it?</p>

<p>Note: the app itself works fine, either with <code>ionic serve</code> or <code>ionic emulate ios</code>, only when deploying to a real device over XCode (since <code>ionic run ios</code> doesn't work, but that's a different story) the white screen appears.</p>

<p>Any help is very much appreciated, as it seems to me I have to either use the localhost+wkwebview plugin or let the users suffer from poor speed.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

36484981,How do I run a job every 2 months,"<p>I have to filter the jobs to be run today based on the date. So, for every scheduled date, I am comparing it to DateTime.Today.Date and getting a list of jobs that are scheduled to run today. 
How can I filter the recurring job based on the given cycle time? 
Example:
->If cycle time is 0, run every month on the scheduled date.
->If cycle time is 2, for the first time run the job on scheduled day and then run every two months.</p>

<p>I have to add cycle time in this way, if schedule date = 3/7/2016, cycle time =2, and if scheduled date == today, run service and add 2 months(5/7/2016) and run service on that date and add 2 months(7/7/2016) and so on.
I wrote this way, but if it once returns true it is not checking the other condition. And this is not working for my scenario.</p>

36494922,I want to implement database to my java web app,"<p>I am newbie with database. I have knowledge of java. I am using play framework(java not scala) to develop a web app.</p>

<p>Now for storing informationof users I need to setup a database. As I have no experience with any type of database. I searched and short listed 3.</p>

<ol>
<li>Mysql</li>
<li>Mongodb</li>
<li>Cassandra</li>
</ol>

<p>I have seen a lot of examples of implement this database in java project using jdbc. Using there query language. Example: SQL in java.</p>

<p>I don't know any query language. Also I don't want to learn query language and delay the project</p>

<p>After going through the database vendors site. They provide drivers. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can I use mysql without learning sql. Using driver. Connecting to database to do crud etc without creating schema. With only java. I know other listed database are schema free. So can I do the query in those database also with only java syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>When I searched I came to know about hibernate and spring data. Can I connect to database using this framework without the use of query language of those databases. </p></li>
<li><p>I wanna know a practical way to connect with those listed database without knowing there query languages.</p></li>

36639607,How exactly do kernel virtual addresses get translated to physical RAM?,"<p>On the surface, this appears to be a silly question. Some patience please.. :-)
Am structuring this qs into 2 parts:</p>

<p><strong>Part 1:</strong>
I fully understand that platform RAM is mapped into the kernel segment; esp on 64-bit systems this will work well. So each kernel virtual address is indeed just an offset from physical memory (DRAM).</p>

<p>Also, it's my understanding that as Linux is a modern virtual memory OS, (pretty much) <em>all</em> addresses are treated as virtual addresses and must ""go"" via hardware - the TLB/MMU - at runtime and then get  translated by the TLB/MMU via kernel paging tables. Again, easy to understand for user-mode processes.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, what about kernel virtual addresses? For efficiency, would it not be simpler to direct-map these (and an identity mapping is indeed setup from PAGE_OFFSET onwards). But still, at runtime, the kernel virtual address <strong><em>must</em></strong> go via the TLB/MMU and get translated right??? Is this actually the case? Or is kernel virtual addr translation just an offset calculation?? (But how can that be, as we <em>must</em> go via hardware TLB/MMU?). As a simple example, lets consider:</p>

<pre><code>char *kptr = kmalloc(1024, GFP_KERNEL);
</code></pre>

<p>Now kptr is a kernel virtual address. 
I understand that virt_to_phys() can perform the offset calculation and return the physical DRAM address. 
But, <em>here's the Actual Question</em>: it can't be done in this manner via software - that would be pathetically slow! So, back to my earlier point: it would have to be translated via hardware (TLB/MMU). 
<em>Is this actually the case??</em></p>

<p><strong>Part 2:</strong>
Okay, lets say this is the case, and we do use paging in the kernel to do this, we must of course setup kernel paging tables; I understand it's rooted at swapper_pg_dir.</p>

<p>(I also understand that vmalloc() unlike kmalloc() is a special case- it's  a pure virtual region that gets backed by physical frames only on page fault).</p>

<p>If (in Part 1) we do conclude that kernel virtual address translation is done via kernel paging tables, then how exactly does the kernel paging table (swapper_pg_dir) get ""attached"" or ""mapped"" to a user-mode process?? This should happen in the context-switch code? How? Where?</p>

<p>Eg.
On an x86_64, 2 processes A and B are alive, 1 cpu.
A is running, so it's higher-canonical addr
<code>0xFFFF8000 00000000 through 0xFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF</code>  ""map"" to the kernel segment, and it's lower-canonical addr
<code>0x0 through 0x00007FFF FFFFFFFF</code>   map to it's private userspace.</p>

<p>Now, if we context-switch A->B, process B's lower-canonical region is unique But
it must ""map"" to the same kernel of course!
How exactly does this happen? How do we ""auto"" refer to the kernel paging table when
in kernel mode? Or is that a wrong statement?</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience, would really appreciate a well thought out answer!</p>

It is important for me to be able to distinguish between the two because in my current Laravel project, we are setting a lot of properties on objects dynamically.  </p>

<p>The distinction in the docs seems to be between the language that vm.$set is ""For Vue instance"" while Vue.set is ""For plain data objects"" and that Vue.set is global:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, there are ways to add a property and make it reactive after
  an instance has been created.</p>
  
  <p>For Vue instances, you can use the $set(path, value) instance method:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>vm.$set('b', 2)
// `vm.b` and `data.b` are now reactive
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>For plain data objects, you can use the global Vue.set(object, key,
  value) method:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>Vue.set(data, 'c', 3)
// `vm.c` and `data.c` are now reactive
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I was wondering if the 3rd ""option"" of doing the above (which is for adding multiple properties at one time) could be used as an equivalent substitute for either of the 2 options above (by adding just 1 property instead of multiple)?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes you may want to assign a number of properties on to an
  existing object, for example using Object.assign() or _.extend().
  However, new properties added to the object will not trigger changes.
  In such cases, create a fresh object with properties from both the
  original object and the mixin object:</p>

<p>But, for example <strong>angularjs's</strong> team provides <a href=""http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/"">protractor</a> for this purpose. </p>

<p>The reason behind protractor as I can see is that protractor waits till angularjs will be loaded and few more features:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Protractor provides some new locator strategies and functions which
  are very helpful to automate the AngularJS application. Examples
  include things like: waitForAngular, By.binding, By.repeater,
  By.textarea, By.model, WebElement.all, WebElement.evaluate, etc.</p>

<p>Then a competitor decide to create one web site to compete with yours. It's pretty easy to open Developers Tools on the browser and check the address of the rest server including api parameters. So, the competitor decides to create a migration tool to make easy for people to abandon your web site and adopt the competitor web site. </p>

36828229,PHP 0 vs False ambiguity,"<p>I've been trying to make a system where certain flags in a MySQL database are checked with php. To see if a certain letter is in the string, I use the function <code>strpos()</code>. If the letter I'm checking for happens to be the first one in the string the function returns 0. However this result seems to be synonymous with the Boolean value for false. I tested this theory with the below code:</p>

<pre><code>if(0 == false){
    echo 'true';
}
</code></pre>

<p>low and behold this evaluates to true and echoes the output inside the block. So, is there a logical way to distinguish between a character being at index 0 or not being part of the string at all? One option that occurred to me was to basically prepend the flags string with some character like an underscore. This way no meaningful characters would ever be at index 0 of the function's return value. That seems like a very dirty patchy way to fix things though. If you have any other ideas I would greatly appreciate your help.
Thanks for reading.</p>

36926798,design a recursive program,"<p>I am not really a newbie in programming, I have been programming for almost three years now. But I still feel frustrated about understanding and designing recursive programs.Sometimes I need to write the whole process down which takes a lot of time. 
Say this program:
Convert Sorted Array to a balanced Binary Search Tree</p>

<pre><code>TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums) {
        return help(nums, 0, nums.size()-1);
    }

    TreeNode* help(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;nums, int start, int end){
        int size=end-start;
        if(size&lt;0)    return NULL;
        if(size==0)    return new TreeNode(nums[start]);
        int mid=(start+end)/2;
        TreeNode* root=new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root-&gt;left=help(nums, start, mid-1);
        root-&gt;right=help(nums, mid+1, end);
        return root;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I have a very hard time tracking how the tree forms....And I definitely cannot design a program like this myself. I have seen 30 recursive programs already, I know I need to practice more to get familiar with it. Just want to know how the thinking process is when you design a recursive program and how you understand a recursive program quickly.

1) Is this an Android Studio 2.1 problem?  Have others seen it?
2) Assuming this is my error and since the error message gives no help in finding the bad module, are there any recommendations on finding the V52 code?  I can't just omit the libraries without breaking large amount of code.  Can one inspect a .jar file to find the code revision?
Thanks in advance.

It should be simple to resolve, but nothing I do works and there's no solution I can find through extensive searching. I'm using Spyder on the latest distribution of Anaconda.</p>

<p>Specifically: I want to compare means between two columns'Trait_A' and 'Trait_B'in a pandas dataframe that I've imported from a csv file. Some of the values in one of the columns are 'Nan' ('Not a Number'). The default setting on the independent samples scipy t-test function doesn't accommodate 'NaN' values. However, <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">setting the 'nan_policy' parameter to 'omit' should deal with this</a>.

The list is sorted and the order of the elements inside the file represents the order these shapes will be drawn. So, if for example the file specifies two rectangle in the same position and with the same sizes, only the second one will be visible (since the first will be overwritten).</p>

<pre><code>list&lt;Shape&gt; shapes;

for (const auto&amp; shape : shapes)

<p>It is straightforward to see that if I have two shapes I cannot invert the order of the drawing operations, and this means that I must be sure that <code>shape2</code> will be always drawn after <code>shape1</code> and so on. Follows that I can not use multiple threads to draw my shapes, and this is a huge disadvantage in terms of performances.</p>

<p>I read that Direct3D supports the depth buffer (or z-buffer), which specifies for each pixel its z-coordinate, such that only the ""visible"" pixels (the onces closer to the viewer) will be drawn, <strong>regardless of the order in which the shapes are drawn</strong>. And I have the depth information of each shape when I read the file.</p>

So my question is, what data structure or method would be most suitable for this purpose? As I said it is not meant to be really complicated but it should be somewhat challenging.

<p>so if I send a 'login' it will go and start a new <code>ChatDialog</code> conversation but it seems to get stuck in this state.

Or should it automatically cancel the conversation when the user sends the same 'login' command more than once? Seems kinda clunky to have to send a 'cancel' command separately.</p>

37126335,Creating a database of foods in Java,"<p>Ive just started learning Java and I spent most of the day watching video tutorials, however now I've decided to do something practical, as I dont think I can absorb anymore information today.</p>

<p>I had an idea to develop a fitness app a while ago, but was hit by how difficult that actually is without any knowledge, so I thought I will start by just creating a macro counter. I created a class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Food {

    private String name;
    public int weight;
    private int calories;
    private int protein;
    private int fat;
    private int carbs;

    public int tCals = weight * calories;
    public int tProtein = weight * protein;
    public int tFat = weight * fat;
    public int tCarbs = weight * carbs;

    public void macrocounter(){
        System.out.println(""Total calories: "" + tCals);
        System.out.println(""\nProtein: "" + tProtein);
        System.out.println(""\nCarbs: "" + tCarbs);
        System.out.println(""\nFat: "" + tFat);
        System.out.println(""-------------"");

    }


}
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I am having problems with is creating a database. I want to add at least 10 simple meals to begin with, they would all have the macros set in stone, the user would just type in the name of the meal and how many grams he ate, then the app would recognize the food from the database, fill in weight, and print out the total macros. </p>

<p>I am not asking here how to write the specific code, just can you point me to what I should read up on more to be able to do this? Java is an insanely vast language, and I am having trouble to find the actual information I need on creating a database.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

37189968,How to have list() consume __iter__ without calling __len__?,"<p>I have a class with both an <code>__iter__</code> and a <code>__len__</code> methods. The latter uses the former to count all elements.</p>

<p>It works like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class A:
    def __iter__(self):
        print(""iter"")
        for _ in range(5):
            yield ""something""

    def __len__(self):
        print(""len"")
        n = 0
        for _ in self:
            n += 1
        return n
</code></pre>

<p>Now if we take e.g. the length of an instance it prints <code>len</code> and <code>iter</code>, as expected:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(A())
len
iter
5
</code></pre>

<p>But if we call <code>list()</code> it calls both <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__len__</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(A())
len
iter
iter
['something', 'something', 'something', 'something', 'something']
</code></pre>

<p>It works as expected if we make a generator expression:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(x for x in A())
iter
['something', 'something', 'something', 'something', 'something']
</code></pre>

<p>I would assume <code>list(A())</code> and <code>list(x for x in A())</code> to work the same but they dont.</p>

<p>Note that it appears to first call <code>__iter__</code>, then <code>__len__</code>, then loop over the iterator:</p>

<pre><code>class B:
    def __iter__(self):
        print(""iter"")

        def gen():
            print(""gen"")
            yield ""something""

        return gen()

    def __len__(self):
        print(""len"")
        return 1

print(list(B()))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>iter
len
gen
['something']
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>How can I get <code>list()</code> not to call <code>__len__</code> so that my instances iterator is not consumed twice? I could define e.g. a <code>length</code> or <code>size</code> method and one would then call <code>A().size()</code> but thats less pythonic.</p>

<p>I tried to compute the length in <code>__iter__</code> and cache it so that subsequent calls to <code>__len__</code> dont need to iter again but <code>list()</code> calls <code>__len__</code> without starting to iterate so it doesnt work.</p>

<p>Note that in my case I work on very large data collections so caching all items is not an option.</p>

Am I simply using it in a way it isn't intended for?</p>

dt[ , .(b, c)]

<p>Gives me the second and third column, b and c. How do I instead EXCLUDE columns b and c. Coming from the data.frame world, I would expect something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>dt[ , -.(b, c)]

I reviewed the data.table FAQ, and the vignette, and cannot seem to find anything.</p>

<p>(I know this is all very simplistic, and I could just select the other two columns. However, this is a microcosm of a much, MUCH bigger data.table I am working with.)</p>

""(30:"" : ""(6:""
"",30:"" : "",6:""
</code></pre>

<p>And the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(30:0.07,(1:0.06,2:0.76))

replaceAll(""(30:"", ""(6:"") &gt;&gt; (6:0.07,(6:0.06,2:0.76))

<p>The problem here is we've replaced a node that was previously replaced. The correct tree should look like:</p>

<pre><code>(6:0.07,(30:0.06,2:0.76))

Because in the Enterprise Application, there is an often need for new roles which will need new policies (as far as i understand) or if you want to implement new type of policy specific for certain client.

So can this new policy base mechanism be more dynamic or, it's idea is entire different?</p>

37259909,C++'s Strict Aliasing Rule - Is the 'char' aliasing exemption a 2-way street?,"<p>Just a couple weeks ago, I learned that the C++ Standard had a strict aliasing rule.  Basically, I had asked a question about shifting bits -- rather than shifting each byte one at a time, to maximize performance I wanted to load my processor's native register's with (32 or 64 bits, respectively) and perform the shift of 4/8 bytes all in a single instruction.</p>

<p>This is the code I wanted to avoid:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char buffer[] = { 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x46 };

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i)
{
  buffer[i] &lt;&lt;= 4; 
  buffer[i] |= (buffer[i + 1] &gt;&gt; 4);
}
buffer[3] &lt;&lt;= 4;
</code></pre>

<p>And instead, I wanted to use something like:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char buffer[] = { 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x46 };
unsigned int *p = (unsigned int*)buffer; // unsigned int is 32 bit on my platform
*p &lt;&lt;= 4;
</code></pre>

<p>Someone called out in a comment that my proposed solution violated the C++ Aliasing rules (because p was of type <code>int*</code> and buffer was of type <code>char*</code> and I was dereferencing p to perform the shift. (Please ignore possible issues of alignment and byte order -- I handle those outside of this snippet)  I was quite surprised to learn about he Strict Aliasing rule since I regularly operate on data from buffers, casting it from one type to another and have never had any issue.  Further investigation revealed that the compiler I use (MSVC) doesn't enforce strict aliasing rules and since I only develop on gcc/g++ in my spare time as a hobby, I likely just hadn't encountered the issue yet.</p>

<p>So then I asked a question about Strict Aliasing Rules and C++'s Placement new operator:</p>

<p>IsoCpp.org offers a FAQ regarding placement new and they provide the following code example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;        // Must #include this to use ""placement new""
#include ""Fred.h""     // Declaration of class Fred
void someCode()
{
  char memory[sizeof(Fred)];     // Line #1
  void* place = memory;          // Line #2
  Fred* f = new(place) Fred();   // Line #3 (see ""DANGER"" below)
  // The pointers f and place will be equal
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The example is simple enough, but I'm asking myself, ""What if someone calls a method on <code>f</code> -- e.g. <code>f-&gt;talk()</code>?  At that point we would be dereferencing <code>f</code>, which points to the same memory location as <code>memory</code> (of type <code>char*</code>. I've read numerous places that there is an exemption for variables of type <code>char*</code> to alias any type, but I was under the impression that it wasn't a ""two-way street"" -- meaning, <code>char*</code> can alias (read/write) any type <code>T</code>, but type <code>T</code> can only be used to alias a <code>char*</code> if <code>T</code> itself is of <code>char*</code>. As I'm typing this, that doesn't make any sense to me and so I'm leaning towards the belief that the claim that my initial (bit shifting example) violated the strict aliasing rule is false.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain what is correct? I've been going nuts with trying to understand what is legal and what is not (despite having read numerous websites and SO posts on the topic)</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

37265188,Partially Specialized Structs vs Overloaded function template,"<p>As we know, function templates cannot be partially specialized in C++. When you are conceptually trying to achieve this, there are two possible solutions you can use. One of them is to use structs with a static function, optionally wrapped with a template function, like so:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
struct BarHelper
{
    static void BarHelp(T t, const U&amp; u)
    {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""bar general\n"";
    }
};

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct BarHelper&lt;T, double&gt;
{
    static void BarHelp(T t, const double&amp; u)
    {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""bar specialized\n"";
    }
};
template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
void bar(T t, const U&amp; u)
{
    BarHelper&lt;T, U&gt;::BarHelp(t, u);
};

<p><code>bar</code> here is optional, you can if you like just use the struct's static member directly (though you will have to then explicitly specify all arguments).</p>

<p>The other approach is just to overload function templates:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T, class U&gt;
void func(T t, const U&amp; u)
{
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""func general\n"";

}
template &lt;class T&gt;
void func(T t, const double&amp; u)
{
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; ""func specialized\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>To me, it seems like the second approach is preferable. For starters it is much less verbose, and far clearer with regards to intent (we're writing functions, so let's use functions instead of pointless wrapper structs). Also, there are some nice tricks you can play with functions to control overload resolution. For instance, you can have non-templated ""tag"" arguments in an inheritance hierarchy, and use implicit conversion to control priority of functions. You also get implicit conversions anytime you concretely specify a type in an overload, and if you don't like that behavior you can just use enable_if on your overload to prevent it (bringing you back to par with structs).</p>

<p>Are there reasons to prefer the partially specialized structs? How general are these reasons? I.e. which should be your ""default""? Does this differ if you: a) plan to implement all specializations yourself, versus b) this is used as a customization point where users can inject their own behavior?</p>

<p>Herb Sutter has a famous blog post about avoiding function template specialization. In it, he also recommends (right near the end) preferring partially specialized structs to overloaded function templates, but he doesn't seem to give any concrete reasons: <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill17.htm"">http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill17.htm</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moral #2: If you're writing a function base template, prefer to write it as a single function template that should never be specialized or <em>overloaded</em></p>

37268686,How can __COUNTER__ cause a ODR-violation here?,"<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjTrfoiB0MQ"">this presentation </a> at around 00:19:00, Andrei Alexandrescu explains the implementation of his <code>SCOPE_EXIT</code> macro. He creates a <code>ScopeGuard</code> object on the stack that executes a lambda on destruction:</p>

<pre><code>#define ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE(str) \
    CONCATENATE(str, __COUNTER__)

namespace detail {
    enum class ScopeGuardOnExit {};
    template &lt;typename Fun&gt;
    ScopeGuard&lt;Fun&gt;
    operator+(ScopeGuardOnExit, Fun&amp;&amp; fn) {
        return ScopeGuard&lt;Fun&gt;(std::forward&lt;Fun&gt;(fn));
    }
}

#define SCOPE_EXIT \
    auto ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE(SCOPE_EXIT_STATE) \
    = ::detail::ScopeGuardOnExit() + [&amp;]()
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so well known (he even states in his slides that this is an old hat). The usage looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
    SCOPE_EXIT{ printf(""foo exits""); };
}
</code></pre>

<p>But at 01:04:00, Chandler Carruth claims that this usage of the <code>__COUNTER__</code> macro to create an ""anonymous"" name would cause an ODR violation when used in an inline function. Can this be true? The macro is only used to create a local variable name, not a type name or something, so how could this cause an ODR violation?</p>

I have tried following the instructions found here and still don't see the logs I expect: <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/android/events#log_events"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/android/events#log_events</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/torMt.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/torMt.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I run the commands described in the link (and shown above) in the terminal within Android Studio this is the output I see:</p>

<pre><code>--------- beginning of system
--------- beginning of crash
--------- beginning of main
05-19 20:14:12.794 I/FA      ( 3083): App measurement is starting up, version: 9080
05-19 20:14:12.794 I/FA      ( 3083): To enable debug logging run: adb shell setprop log.tag.FA VERBOSE
</code></pre>

<p>and this is what is shown in the Android Monitor tab in logcat:</p>

<pre><code>05-19 20:14:12.794 3083-3083/com.nick.app I/FA: App measurement is starting up, version: 9080

</code></pre>

<p>What I expect to see is an indication the various ""events"" I have logged are logged correctly. I have seen them in the firebase developer console which leads me to believe I have implemented them properly, I would just like a quicker way to know for testing purposes. </p>

<p>What steps need to be taken to properly view the firebase analytics debug logs?</p>

I'm not sure if it should go in the constructor of my App container, or should i load it inside my component (in my example: ""MyDropdown"")</p>

<p>My main App:</p>

<pre><code>import MyDropdown from '../components/mydropdown';
// Should i import my action here and then...
// import { loadData } from '../actions';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className=""page-content""&gt;
        &lt;div className=""option-bar""&gt;
          // SEND it as a PROP inside MyDropdown... 
          &lt;MyDropdown /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
export default App;
</code></pre>

<p>My Component</p>

<pre><code>// OR.. Should i load it in my MyDropdown component here?
import { loadData } from '../actions';

class MyDropdown extends Component {
  // If i load it here on load, how do i do it?
  render() {

      &lt;select&gt;
         {renderOptions()}
      &lt;/select&gt;
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried componentDidMount() inside my App class, but it didnt seem to work. It seems to make sense to put the initialize data and call to actions there as it'll be all centralized, instead of calling actions inside my child components. Also, i'll have multiple select boxes that need to be loaded on startup, so my App class might grow quite a bit, is that the correct way to do it? I'm not sure what the best practice is as i've only just started learning react.</p>

I have a component that hides/shows using <code>*ngIf</code> based on a simple Boolean. When the component becomes visible I want to apply focus to a child element within its template.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong><br>
If I flip the Boolean value the component shows correctly but if I then try and get a reference to the child element using <code>this._elRef.nativeElement.querySelector(""div#test"")</code> it just comes back <code>null</code>. If I wait a few seconds the same code will return the reference to the element as I expected.</p>

<p><strong>Speculation</strong><br>
I'm assuming that after flipping the Boolean angular goes through a whole rendering cycle to reveal the newly visible component and that this has not finished by the time I apply the <code>querySelector()</code> in the next line.</p>

<p><strong>What I'd Like To Know</strong><br>
So what I'm wondering is, how can I be sure that my <code>ngIf</code> has taken effect and the elements are their in the DOM to be selected?<br>Is there such a thing as a callback for <code>ngIf</code> or can I force the view to update and get a callback from that?</p>

I eventually hope to use for C++ stuff, but right now I'm just trying to get the examples working. I'm using the default compilers that came with Ubuntu (GNU 5.3.1), and Cmake version 3.5.2. I've been following the directions on PCL's website (<a href=""http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/using_pcl_pcl_config.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/writing_pcd.php#writing-pcd"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>), but am currently stuck at the point where I use the 'make' command after letting Cmake build the things it wants to build. This is the error I get</p>

<pre><code>[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/pcd_write.dir/pcd_write.cpp.o

<p>Cmake also gives me warnings when I'm building things, and those are here. They don't stop it from running, but they might be relevant.</p>

<pre><code>-- Found OpenNI2: /usr/lib/libOpenNI2.so

-- The imported target ""vtkRenderingPythonTkWidgets"" references the file

but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:
* The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.
* An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.
* The installation package was faulty and contained
   "" /usr/lib/cmake/vtk-6.2/VTKTargets.cmake""
    but not all the files it references.
</code></pre>

<p>Also, in case it's relevant, I did a potentially stupid thing earlier when it was giving me similar warnings about VTK. It was telling me that /user/bin/vtk was renamed or something, and it was.  This version of VTK called itself vtk6. I tried to root around in the makefiles to find that and change it so Cmake would know to look for vtk6, but I couldn't find it anywhere, so I went into the bin and made a copy of vtk6 named vtk, and it stopped giving me a warning. </p>

<p>Other relevant versions of stuff I'm using are eigen3 3.2.92, boost 1.58.0, flan 1.8.4, vtk6, and libopenni2 version 2.2.0.3</p>

<p>Again, not sure how much of this is actually important, but better to be too specific than too vague IMO.</p>

// Create a reference to 'mountains.jpg'
var mountainsRef = storageRef.child('mountains.jpg');

// Create a reference to 'images/mountains.jpg'

<p>In my case I have two command buffers. And I want the second command buffer to execute after the first one.</p>

<pre><code>submitInfo.pCommandBuffers = &amp;firstCommandBuffer;
vkQueueSubmit(queue, 1, &amp;submitInfo, VK_NULL_HANDLE);

// wait for first command buffer to finish
submitInfo.pCommandBuffers = &amp;secondCommandBuffer;
vkQueueSubmit(queue, 1, &amp;submitInfo, VK_NULL_HANDLE);
</code></pre>

<p>What kind of synchronization is best for this? 
If I use <code>vkQueueWaitIdle(queue)),</code> is that the same thing as using a fence or should I use event or semaphores for this?</p>

<p>If I send multiple commandbuffer to the queue at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;VkCommandBuffer&gt; submitCmdBuffers = {
        firstCommandBuffer,
        secondCommandBuffer
    };
    submitInfo.commandBufferCount = submitCmdBuffers.size();
    submitInfo.pCommandBuffers = submitCmdBuffers.data();
</code></pre>

<p>Is there still a way to synchronize between the first and the second one?</p>

<p>I get that not causing side effects helps us get the benefits of a unidirectional flow of data.</p>

<p><strong>I just really don't get what is so important about not mutating the old state.</strong></p>

37533863,TensorFlow - Low GPU usage on Titan X,"<p>For a while, I have been noticing that TensorFlow (v0.8) does not seem to fully use the computation power of my Titan X. For several CNNs that I have been running the GPU usage does not seem to exceed ~30%. Typically the GPU utilization is even lower, more like 15%. One particular example of a CNN that shows this behavior is the CNN from DeepMind's Atari paper with Q-learning (see link below for code). </p>

<p>When I see other people of our lab running CNNs written in Theano or Torch the GPU usage is typically 80%+. This makes me wondering, why are the CNNs that I write in TensorFlow so 'slow' and what can I do to make more efficient use of the GPU processing power? Generally, I am interested in ways to profile the GPU operations and discover where the bottlenecks are. Any recommendations how to do this are very welcome since this seems not really possible with TensorFlow at the moment.</p>

<p>Things I did to find out more about the cause of this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Analyzing TensorFlow's <strong>device placement</strong>, everything seems to be on gpu:/0 so looks OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <strong>cProfile</strong>, I have optimized the batch generation and other preprocessing steps. The preprocessing is performed on a single thread, but the actual optimization performed by TensorFlow steps take much longer (see average runtimes below). One obvious idea to increase the speed is by using TFs queue runners, but since the batch preparation is already 20x faster than optimization I wonder whether this is going to make a big difference.</p>

<pre><code>Avg. Time Batch Preparation: 0.001 seconds
Avg. Time Train Operation:   0.021 seconds
Avg. Time Total per Batch:   0.022 seconds (45.18 batches/second)

37542971,How does Rust's type inference work across multiple statements?,"<p>Rust performs type inference in fairly advanced situations. Could someone please explain (or point to) the rules that describe what can and cannot be inferred?</p>

<p>The first one is simple: The type of a binding is the type of the bound expression:</p>

<pre><code>let n = 10u32;

// Same as:
//   vvvvv
let n: u32 = 10u32;
</code></pre>

<p>This next one is more surprising to me: The generic parameter on the right is deduced from the binding type on the left:</p>

<pre><code>let n: u32 = ""10"".parse().unwrap();

// same as:            vvvvvvv
let n: u32 = ""10"".parse::&lt;u32&gt;().unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>This also works for ""member functions"" of generic types:</p>

<pre><code>let b = Box::new(10u32);

// same as:
//        vvvvv      vvvvvvv
let b: Box&lt;u32&gt; = Box::&lt;u32&gt;::new(10u32);
</code></pre>

<p>But the strangest of all is type inference across statements:</p>

<pre><code>let v = Vec::new();   // no type!
v.push(10u32);        // apparently v is Vec&lt;u32&gt;?!
// v.push(10i32);     // type error
</code></pre>

37545626,Python - Loop parallelisation with joblib,"<p>I would like some help understanding exactly what I have done/ why my code isn't running as I would expect. </p>

<p>I have started to use joblib to try and speed up my code by running a (large) loop in parallel.</p>

<p>I am using it like so:</p>

<pre><code>from joblib import Parallel, delayed
def frame(indeces, image_pad, m):

    XY_Patches = np.float32(image_pad[indeces[0]:indeces[0]+m, indeces[1]:indeces[1]+m,  indeces[2]])
    XZ_Patches = np.float32(image_pad[indeces[0]:indeces[0]+m, indeces[1],                  indeces[2]:indeces[2]+m])
    YZ_Patches = np.float32(image_pad[indeces[0],                 indeces[1]:indeces[1]+m,  indeces[2]:indeces[2]+m])

    return XY_Patches, XZ_Patches, YZ_Patches


def Patch_triplanar_para(image_path, patch_size):

    Image, Label, indeces =  Sampling(image_path)

    n = (patch_size -1)/2
    m = patch_size

    image_pad = np.pad(Image, pad_width=n, mode='constant', constant_values = 0)

    A = Parallel(n_jobs= 1)(delayed(frame)(i, image_pad, m) for i in indeces)
    A = np.array(A)
    Label = np.float32(Label.reshape(len(Label), 1))
    R, T, Y =  np.hsplit(A, 3)

    return R, T, Y, Label
</code></pre>

<p>I have been experimenting with ""n_jobs"", expecting that increasing this will speed up my function. However as I increase n_jobs, things slow down quite significantly. When running this code without ""Parallel"", things are slower, until I increase the number of jobs from 1. </p>

<p>Why is this the case? I understood that the more jobs I run, the faster the script? am i using this wrong?</p>

37587676,A new web app from scratch on the Microsoft stack (Core/4.6) and web client technologies,"<p>We are about to begin developing a new big web application from scratch, and we have some uncertainty regarding the path to take with the Microsoft stack. Can a new application (enterprise scale) can be created with the new .NET CORE stack (i.e. ASP.NET CORE, MVC 6, EF 7 etc.) and will prove stable and performant? Meaning, is it ready for production use?</p>

<p>That is on the server side. We have the same uncertainty regarding the client side technologies. Angular 2 is also not in a finished state. We don't know if it can be used in production or not. Same with React. We are probably not going to use Knockout as it seems that it is not heavily developed anymore (but maybe I'm wrong).</p>

<p>So, to sum it up, we really want to use .NET CORE and Angular 2/React, but is it a good idea to use them in their current state?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,</p>

<pre><code>n = 2
if(UserPress == Spacebar):
    CellSplits = True
    CellParts = n*2
